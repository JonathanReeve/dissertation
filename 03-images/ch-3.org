* Introduction
Having measured color vision in Chapter 1, and object vision in Chapter 2, we now turn to their aggregate, the image, in order to further interrogate questions of literary historical trends raised by these previous chapters. The analyses in Chapter 1 find an overall increase in color terms, and hued visuality more generally, across the 19th and 20th centuries. Those of Chapter 2 find a general increase in the presence of objects and shapes, as well. What could account for these trends? I have already discussed some generic considerations, in the LCSH analysis of Chapter 1, and in some of the lists provided in Chapter 2. But visuality is a complex phenomenon, which takes place across genres.

In this chapter, I argue that three interrelated modes can largely account for the increase in visuality in 20th century British literature: an /descriptive/ mode, an /imagistic/ mode, and a /impressionist/ mode. Although the term /mode/ is inadequate to describe what others in computational literary analysis have called, speaking of their empirical findings, a /thread/ or a /signal/, I prefer it to /genre/ and /type/, which imply that these categories are even more mutually exclusive than they are.

# We have been under-discussing these things, and thinking about them incorrectly.

I am also using the /-ist/ suffix loosely. Although there is a well-defined movement in early 20th Century poetry called Imagism or /Imagisme/, which I will discuss at length, I won't be restricting my discussion to those seven or so poets, but will consider a wider plurality of imagisms. Similarly, although there is a movement in 19th Century French painting called /Impressionism/, with its own membership rosters, I'll deal with implicit, as well as explicit, impressionisms as they appear in literature. And while description doesn't have an associated school, its effects on the historical literary visuality appear just as strongly.

These /-isms/ of the turn of the century, a period which Mary Ann Caws terms /A Century of Isms/, carry with them rules, manifestos, prescriptions, and proscriptions, and a rich body of autoexegetic critical writing, perhaps more so than any other artistic movements [cite:@cawsmanifesto]. While these critical works should not be considered the sole means of interpreting their movements, they nonetheless provide a useful means of understanding their philosophical underpinnings.

In literary scholarship, studies of Imagism and literary impressionism have largely fallen out of fashion. Serious treatments of literary description have had a similar fate. While it is not the purpose of this chapter to revive interest in the literary merits of Imagism, or to argue for a resurrection in the thought surrounding literary impressionism, I will argue that we can't explain the rise in visuality in 20th century literature without these -isms.

Since imagisms and impressionisms are much harder to identify computationally, the quantitative exploration of this chapter will be one of description detection, and analysis of diachronic trends in literary description. While the boundaries and the shapes of descriptions change over time, confounding any efforts to measurement, as I will explain later, I find that literary description generally decreases through the 19th and early 20th centuries. This complicates the findings of the past two chapters, since it suggests, for one, that descriptive modes on their own account for less of the literary visuality than one might expect.

* Description

Literary description, the first mode of visuality I'll treat in this chapter, has received relatively little critical attention, much of which is dismissive of it and its role in fiction. The remainder came into fashion briefly, in the 1980s, before passing away, and is primarily relegated to French and German literary theory, bearing the mark of the continental philological tradition.

José Manuel Lopes, in /Foregrounded Description in Prose Fiction/, contends that critics have largely considered it "purely ornamental, redundant, or even irrelevant," and that since the nineteenth century, they've considered descriptions an "'extra' or as a dispensable ornament of narration, if not as a cumbersome set of textual segments that, standing in the way of storytelling, function as mere 'catalysts,' that is, as a series of devices to interrupt or delay the sequential unfolding of plots" [cite:@lopes1995foregrounded 6].

Lopes refers to Roland Barthes' famous essay of 1968, "The Reality Effect," in which he attempts to explain the presence of a detail in a stort story by Flaubert. In this story, we are told that "an old piano supported, under a barometer, a pyramidal heap of boxes and cartons" [cite:@barthes1989bruissement quoted in 141]. About details, Barthes claims, that "they seem to correspond to a kind of narrative /luxury/, lavish to the point of offering many 'futile' details and thereby increasing the cost of narrative information" [cite:@barthes1989bruissement quoted in 141].
This economy of words, seems almost to defend brutalist architecture against bourgeois Gothic revival, as if they were mutually exclusive, and existed in a zero-sum relationship.

This view is shared by  Georg Lukács, who in his much-discussed essay "Narrate or Describe?" of 1936, pits narration against description. Comparing Zola's /Nana/ and Tolstoy's /Anna Karenina/, he prefers Tolstoy's style in that, "in Zola the race is /described/ from the standpoint of an observer; in Tolstoy it is /narrated/ from the standpoint of a participant" [cite:@lukacs2005 111]. Of Flaubert's descriptions in /Madame Bovary/, he complains that "to the reader they seem undifferentiated, additional elements of the environment Flaubert is describing. They become dabs of colour in a painting which rises above a lifeless level only insofar as it is elevated to an ironic symbol of philistinism. The painting assumes an importance which does not arise out of the subjective importance of the events, to which it is scarcely related, but from the artifice in the formal stylization" [cite:@lukacs2005 115].

Gotthold Lessing, as well, in his /Laocoon: or, The limits of Poetry and Painting/, rejects description as a valid mode for poetry, and for all other literary writing, claiming that dynamic actions are the appropriate subjects for poetry, while static bodies are the appropriate subjects of painting: "those objects which are co-existent, or whose parts are co-existent, are called bodies; consequently bodies, with their visible properties, are the legitimate subjects of painting. Those things, on the contrary, which are consecutive, or whose parts are consecutive, are termed, generally speaking, actions. Actions are therefore the legitimate subjects of poetry" [cite:@lessing_laocoon_1836 150-1].

Part of why description is so often misunderstood is that it's so hard to extricate from narrative. Guido Isekenmeier argues that description is largely considered "doubly ontologically anchored," meaning that it is "definable in terms of both the kind of phenomena in the fictional world that are descriptively constituted and the set of linguistic devices in the literary text that constitute description" [cite:@isekenmeier2017 80]. To demonstrate this doubly self-constituted nature of description, consider a paragraph from /Madame Bovary/, the novel Lukács is criticizing.

#+begin_quote
Towards four in the morning Charles, well wrapped up in his cloak, set off for Les Bertaux. Still drowsy with the warmth of slumber, he let himself be lulled by the peaceful trotting of his horse. Whenever it stopped of its own accord at one of those holes bordered with thorns that farmers dig along the edge of their ploughed land, Charles, waking with a start, would quickly remember the broken leg, and try to recall all the fractures that he knew. It was no longer raining; day was breaking, and, on the leafless branches of the apple trees, birds sat motionless, fluffing out their tiny feathers in the cold morning wind. The flat landscape extended as far as the eye could see, the clumps of trees round the farms making widely spaced splashes of dark purple on that vast grey surface which, at the horizon, merged with the dreary tones of the sky. Charles, from time to time, would open his eyes; then, his mind growing weary and sleep returning unbidden, he would fall into a kind of doze in which, his recent sensations mingling with his memories, he saw himself as double, at once a student and a married man, lying, as he had just been doing, in his bed, and walking across a surgical ward as in the past.
#+end_quote
[cite:@9780192840394 13]
[fn::Vers quatre heures du matin, Charles, bien enveloppé dans son manteau, se mit en route pour les Bertaux. Encore endormi par la chaleur du sommeil, il se laissait bercer au trot pacifique de sa bête. Quand elle s'arrêtait d'elle-même devant ces trous entourés d'épines que l'on creuse au bord des sillons, Charles se réveillant en sursaut, se rappelait vite la jambe cassée, et il tâchait de se remettre en mémoire toutes les fractures qu'il savait. La pluie ne tombait plus; le jour commençait à venir, et, sur les branches des pommiers sans feuilles, des oiseaux se tenaient immobiles, hérissant leurs petites plumes au vent froid du matin. La plate campagne s'étalait à perte de vue, et les bouquets d'arbres autour des fermes faisaient, à intervalles éloignés, des taches d'un violet noir sur cette grande surface grise, qui se perdait à l'horizon dans le ton morne du ciel. Charles, de temps à autre, ouvrait les yeux; puis, son esprit se fatiguant et le sommeil revenant de soi-même, bientôt il entrait dans une sorte d'assoupissement où, ses sensations récentes se confondant avec des souvenirs, lui-même se percevait double, à la fois étudiant et marié, couché dans son lit comme tout à l'heure, traversant une salle d'opérés comme autrefois.]

These six sentences begin and end with action: Charles setting off for Les Bertaux in 1, and Charles imagining himself and his past in 6. The long descriptive passage then, in 2--5, is bookended by this action. The description is subordinated to, and supported by, its narrative. The details are not, as Lukács suggests, "undifferentiated, additional elements of the environment," but inextricably narrative in their own right. They are essential to understanding Charles's emotional state. The "gray," "dreary" landscape mirrors Charles's mood, and is caused by it. While there are "dabs of colour"---the "splashes of dark purple on that vast grey surface" is remarkably paintery---they hardly amount only to "an ironic symbol of philistinism," as Lukács argues. Rather, these details express liminalities which support, and constitute, Charles's feeling of doubleness. His internal state, between sleeping and waking, between the experience of the present and memories of the past, are mirrored in a rainy day without rain; the time between night and day; a winter scene with birds on the trees; and the color gray itself: neither black nor white.

To choose a more recent example, consider this strikingly similar passage from /Mrs Dalloway/, which is even more hard to parse with a narration/description binary:

#+begin_quote
She had the oddest sense of being herself invisible, unseen; unknown; there being no more marrying, no more having of children now, but only this astonishing and rather solemn progress with the rest of them, up Bond Street, this being Mrs. Dalloway; not even Clarissa any more; this being Mrs. Richard Dalloway.

Bond Street fascinated her; Bond street early in the morning in the season; its flags flying; its shows; no splash; no glitter; one roll of tweed in the shop where her father had bought his suits for twenty years; a few pearls; salmon on an iceblock.

"That is all," she said, looking at the fishmonger's. "That is all," she repeated, pausing for a moment at the window of a glove shop where, before the War, you could buy almost perfect gloves. And her old Uncle William used to say a lady is known by her shoes and her gloves.
#+end_quote
[cite:@woolf21_mrs]

Here, Clarissa, also out walking early in the morning, has been out walking, running errands, and daydreaming.
Like Charles, she imagines herself doubly, both Clarissa and Mrs. Dalloway. There are details, but they are not unnecessary or unimportant: they are threads which lead to Clarissa's memories. They not only tell us a bit about Clarissa's history, but show how her mind works, how she daydreams, how details from the street make her remember her father.

"That is all," her deictic comment to herself, is at once a continuation of "this being Mrs. Dalloway," but is connected to the dead salmon, at which she is staring when she says it. It denotes a lack which is repeated in Bond Street's "no spash; no glitter." In contrast, the other things in this scene are overloaded: they are /more/ than what they appear, since they contain also family memories: the roll of tweed is "where her father had bought his suits" and the glove shop reminds her of something her Uncle William used to say. The way that, according to her uncle, "a woman is known by" her gloves also reprises the motif of "being Mrs. Dalloway," in which a woman is known by her husband's name.

# How do these novels score in terms of description?

So, in most cases, description is never separate from narrative, but does the work of narrative, using image. One would never say of a film---any film that is narrative---that certain of its images or scenes are descriptive, rather than narrative, and perform no narrative functions. And one would never say of a sufficiently narrative painting---a painting that is said to "tell a story," such as, say, Rembrandt's /The Night Watch/---that its details are unnecessary, that a stray orange on the ground, or a dog curled up in the corner, had no purpose and shouldn't exist. Yet fiction is the one medium that comes under scrutiny for its images. Part of this may have to do with fiction's inherent intermediality.

In Lessing, writing is always defined in opposition to painting, and this intermedial definition abounds in the thought surrounding description. In /Description in Literature and Other Media,/ Werner Wolf argues that "description appears to be not only a /transgeneric/ but also a /transmedial/ phenomenon." Among his given evidence are a scene from /Alice in Wonderland/, in which the narrator gestures towards an illustration on a facing page, saying, "if you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture" [cite:@9789042023109 3].

And there are plenty of other, less explicit, intermedialities, as well, not the least of which is the ekphrastic tradition, which claims as its progenitor the Homeric shield of Achilles, and which renders a visible art object. Another genre is the 18th Century French monograph genre of the /Description/. Philippe Hamon's monumental study of the description, /Introduction à L'Analyse du Descriptif/, begins with a history of this genre, which includes books with such titles as /Description historique de la ville de Paris,/ of 1742, or /Description des curiosités des églises de Paris,/ of 1759 [cite:@hamonIntroductionAnalyseDescriptif1981 11]. At a time when mechanized reproductions images was considerably more expensive, a picture may have been worth much more, as the cliché goes, than a thousand words. But in another sense these books were /readings/, in the literary critical sense, of their objects, not unlike those which visual artists create of their models or subjects.

Hamon also cites the encyclopedic tradition of Diderot and others which, born of a rationalist impulse to interpret nature, finds description to be one of the primary tools of science, or "natural philosophy." The power of this kind of description, in science and literary prose, is therefore much more than decorative: it's evocative---it does what art is meant to do, which is to evoke, call forth, in its etymological sense, a reaction, an emotion, a thought, or a mental image.

The modernists themselves were in tune to this power of description. Ford Madox Ford (then Ford Madox Hueffer), in a March 1913 essay in /Poetry and Drama/, describes the difference in writing styles between a /Times/ agricultural correspondent, and W. H. Hudson, the naturalist and author of the novel /Green Mansions/, as one of subjective visuality. Unlike the /Times/ writer, Ford explains, Hudson "will give you nothing but the pleasure of coming into contact with his temperament, and I doubt whether, if you read with the greatest care his description of false sea-buckthorn (/hippophae rhamnoides/) you would very willingly recognise that greenish-grey plant, with the spines and the berries like reddish amber, if you came across it" [cite:@hueffer_poetry_drama, 38].

** In pedagogy

In pedagogical texts, we see many of these same types of assumptions about description: that it is separate from narration, that it is opposed to narration, that it is a methodical, sometimes scientific mode which is therefore tedious, and so on. In a 1902 American textbook of composition by Mary ROse and  , /Composition and Rhetoric Based on Literary Models,/ which may well have been taught in Pound's or Eliot's undergraduate classes, we see a section on "the relation between narration and description" which begins:

#+begin_quote
If we study the English novel historically we shall find that the early novelists massed their description, giving us sometimes two or three pages of it at once. These extended descriptions interrupt the story, which is our main interest, and become very tiresome. Later writers, realizing how prone we are to skip the descriptive passages when massed in this way, have broken up this element into shorter paragraphs, or even into sentences, and have scattered it throughout the book, so that it no longer retards the action. [cite:@rose1902composition 145].
#+end_quote

Is description really "tiresome,"  as Rose and Beatty suggest? Do readers simply skip descriptions? Or are they the very elements which lend vivacity to the literary work?

The hard narration/description dichotomy is still taken for granted here, but Rose and Beatty acknowledge that description may be interwoven into passages, or paragraphs, that are otherwise narrative. A 1903 textbook, /Composition-rhetoric from literature/, presents a similar dichotomy, but is less dismissive of description. The chapter on literary description begins, "we have found that description enters largely into literary narration," suggesting that they are more intertwined than separate [cite:@mooney1903composition 81].

Richard Green Moulton's 1915 textbook, /The Modern Study of Literature/, gives a different typology, one in which description and "presentation," along with poetry and prose, are four modes or "cardinal points" of literary form:

#+begin_quote
These four things, description and presentation, poetry and prose, are the four cardinal points of literary form. They are not to be conceived as four kinds of literature; but, like the cardinal points of the compass, they represent four necessary directions in which literary activity can move. Literature, developing from its starting-point in the ballad dance, finds its movement bounded in these four directions. The result of the movement so bounded gives us the six elements of literary form. [cite:@moulton1915modern 17]
#+end_quote

[cite:@Fig:moulton] shows Moulton's cardinal points in diagram. This view enables description and narration ("presentation") to coexist, as with poetry and prose: poetic prose and prosaic poetry mirror narrative description and descriptive narration.

** Experiment: quantifying description

Does visuality, which I model in the previous chapters with its expressions in colors and objects, correlate with description? To measure this, I train a convolutional neural network to recognize paragraphs containing literary descriptions. I begin with a corpus of manually identified paragraphs of literary descriptions, from a range of novels from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as Charlotte Brontë's /Jane Eyre/, Thomas Hardy's /Tess of the d'Urbervilles/, and Virginia Woolf's /Mrs Dalloway/. I then create a corpus of non-descriptions, by randomly sampling paragraphs from these novels not labeled as descriptions. [fn::Although description certainly occurs on a sub-paragraph level, the paragraph is a useful semantic unit. For an in-depth look at the paragraph as a literary unit, see [cite:@algee-hewitt_paragraphs:_2015]]

Here are some examples of paragraphs I've manually labeled as description. The first is from /Tess of the d'Urbervilles/:

#+begin_quote
This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass. The atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that hue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine. Arable lands are few and limited; with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major. Such is the Vale of Blackmoor. [cite:@HardyTessUrbervilles2007 47]
#+end_quote

Using the Python libraries SpaCy and Prodigy, from Explosion AI, I train a multi-label text categorizer, with the labels "description" and "nondescription." The model uses position-sensitive embeddings, and uses a convolutional neural network, based on an existing SpaCy language model of English. The training process holds back 20% of the training data, in order to evaluate its guesses, and iterates through about 5,000 epochs, until it achieves an 85% accuracy. The result is a model which can guess whether a paragraph of text is a description or not. Since it's a multi-label model, it gives two probabilties for each paragraph it sees: the likelihood of it being a description paragraph, and the likelihood of it being a non-description paragraph.

Here are some examples of paragraphs which have been labeled with high probabilities of being a description:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The proportions of paragraphs labeled as descriptions, when viewed diachronically, are shown in [cite:@fig:descriptionProportions].

#+INCLUDE: "03-images/includes/description_proportions.html" export html

#+CAPTION: Object proportions over time, $C_{PG2}$
#+LABEL: fig:descriptionProportions
[[./images/dummy.png]]

My initial hypothesis was that the proportion of descriptive paragraphs would increase over time, tracking the trends discovered in the two previous chapters: the increase in colors and shapes over time. However, the opposite occurred: a gradual decline in descriptive paragraphs over time. Several factors may account for this trend. The first, and most probable, is that descriptive paragraphs become less recognizable to the model I've been using to detect them. Since the model is trained on unambiguous examples, such as the paragraphs quoted above, it's possible that description is more tightly woven into narrative in the twentieth century than the nineteeth.

If visuality, measured by color and shape, increases at the turn of the century, but description as a whole decreases, this might mean that narrative, in fiction, becomes more visual, instead of fiction becoming more descriptive.

The texts with the highest proportions of description are non-fiction.
 - Hamon points to eighteenth-century examples of /descriptions/, especially the natural sciences.

  - texts with the highest proportions of description are non-fiction
    - esp. Walter Pater

Here are some of the texts with the highest proportions of descriptions:

| Year | Title                                 | Author                 | % Descr. Paras. |

| 1893 | The Rhythm of Life                    | Alice Meynell          |              72 |
| 1916 | Letters from America                  | Rupert Brooke          |              71 |
| 1887 | Memories and Portraits                | Robert Louis Stevenson |              69 |

| 1880 | Round About a Great Estate            | Richard Jefferies      |              67 |
| 1841 | On Heroes, Hero-Worship ...           | Thomas Carlyle         |              67 |
| 1896 | Studies in Early Victorian Literature | Frederic Harrison      |              63 |
| 1865 | The Life of John Clare                | Frederick Martin       |              63 |
| 1907 | The Boats of the "Glen Carrig"        | William Hope Hodgson   |              62 |
| 1887 | Imaginary Portraits                   | Walter Pater           |              62 |

Strikingly, this list consists primarily of non-fiction or quasi-fictional works: essays, memoir, biography, and descriptive collections of "sketches" or "impressions."

/The Rhythm of Life/ is a collection of short essays from the poet, suffragist, and essayist Alice Meynell, author of a critical work on John Ruskin, and several other poetic, descriptive essay collections [cite:@meynell1893rhythm;cite:@meynell1900john]. Here is a passage from "The Sun," which shows how descriptive this volume of essays can get:

#+begin_quote
Nowhere else does the greater light so rule the day, so measure, so divide, so reign, make so imperial laws, so visibly kindle, so immediately quicken, so suddenly efface, so banish, so restore, as in a plain like this of Suffolk with its enormous sky. The curious have an insufficient motive for going to the mountains if they do it to see the sunrise. The sun that leaps from a mountain peak is a sun past the dew of his birth; he has walked some way towards the common fires of noon. But on the flat country the uprising is early and fresh, the arc is wide, the career is long. The most distant clouds, converging in the beautiful and little-studied order of cloud-perspective (for most painters treat clouds as though they formed perpendicular and not horizontal scenery), are those that gather at the central point of sunrise.
#+end_quote
[cite:@meynell1893rhythm]

Other essays in the volume deal with similarly descriptive, noun-heavy, extended treatments of single objects or scenes. "The Flower" is a meditation on flowers. "Domus Angusta" is an architectural discussion. "By the Railway Side" describes a rail journey through Tuscany. Others are writings on literature: Shelley, Wilde, and Swinburne all make appearances, as do the lesser-known American poets Oliver Wendell Holmes and James Russell Lowell.

Two other volumes on this list are collections of literary critical essays: William Ernest Henley's /Views and Reviews: Essays in Appreciation: Literature/ deals with Dickens, Thackeray, Disraeli, Dumas, and Meredith, among others; so does Frederic Harrison's /Studies in Early Victorian Literature/, which adds essays on George Eliot and Thomas Carlyle [cite:@henley_views_2007;@harrison_studies_2006].

Walter Pater's /Imaginary Portraits/ stands out as a generic anomaly: imaginary "portraits" of fictional people in historical times and places, these sketches are not quite narrative enough to be short stories, and could not be called novelistic, either. Here's how it begins:

#+begin_quote
They have been renovating my father's large workroom. That delightful, tumble-down old place has lost its moss-grown tiles and the green weather-stains we have known all our lives on the high whitewashed wall, opposite which we sit, in the little sculptor's yard, for the coolness, in summertime. Among old Watteau's workpeople came his son, "the genius," my father's godson and namesake, a dark-haired youth, whose large, unquiet eyes seemed perpetually wandering to the various drawings which lie exposed here. My father will have it that he is a genius indeed, and a painter born. We have had our September Fair in the Grande Place, a wonderful stir of sound and colour in the wide, open space beneath our windows. And just where the crowd was busiest young Antony was found, hoisted into one of those empty niches of the old Hotel de Ville, sketching the scene to the life, but with a kind of grace—a marvellous tact of omission, as my father pointed out to us, in dealing with the vulgar reality seen from one's own window—which has made trite old Harlequin, Clown, and Columbine, seem like people in some fairyland; or like infinitely clever tragic actors, who, for the humour of the thing, have put on motley for once, and are able to throw a world of serious innuendo into their burlesque looks, with a sort of comedy which shall be but tragedy seen from the other side. He brought his sketch to our house to-day, and I was present when my father questioned him and commended his work. But the lad seemed not greatly pleased, and left untasted the glass of old Malaga which was offered to him. His father will hear nothing of educating him as a painter. Yet he is not ill-to-do, and has lately built himself a new stone house, big and grey and cold. Their old plastered house with the black timbers, in the Rue des Cardinaux, was prettier; dating from the time of the Spaniards, and one of the oldest in Valenciennes.

[cite:@pater1894imaginary]

* Impression / Impressionisms

In contrast with Imagism, literary impressionism was not a delineated movement with manifestos and anthologies. Instead, it is largely a critical term used to describe visual qualities of prose, at roughly the same time period as imagism. The name derives from Impressionism, the school of French painting which flourished in the mid- to late-nineteeth century, and is often used to describe the styles of fiction writers such as Joseph Conrad, Katherine Mansfield, Henry James, and Ford Madox Ford.

Like the school of painting, literary impressionism uses bright colors and broad strokes to convey an impression of a visual scene. In fact, its earliest definitions were from the age, and home country, of Impressionism. Ferdinand Brunetière, in /Le Roman Naturaliste/, defines "l'impressionnisme littéraire" as simply "une transposition systématique des moyens d'expression d'un art, qui est l'art de peindre, dans le domaine d'une autre art, qui est l'art d'écrire" [cite:@brunetière1883roman 88].[fn:: a systematic transposition of the means of expression of one art, the art of painting, to the domain of another art, the art of writing.] In discussing a novel by Alphonse Daudet, Brunetière uses analogies from painting:
"chaque scène ainsi devient un tableau, qui s'arrange comme dans une toile suspendue sous les yeux du lexteur, complète en elle-même, isolée des autres, comme dans une galerie, par sa bordure, par son cadre, par un large pan de mur vide" [cite:@brunetière1883roman 89].[fn:: each scene becomes a tableau which arranges itself like a canvas suspended under the eyes of the reader, complete in itself, isolated from others, as if in a gallery, by its border, by its frame, by a large expanse of blank wall.]

As with the school of painting, literary impressionism as a style or practice, appears to have begun in its currently recognizable form in mid-nineteenth century France. Maria Kronegger's 1973 monograph /Literary Impressionism/ treats four francophone writers and only one anglophone: André Gide, Gustauve Flaubert, Marcel Proust, Jean-Paul Sartre, and James Joyce [cite:@kronegger1973literary].

But shortly thereafter, the term appears in English. In an 1893 letter to the editor of the /National Review/, in response to a lecture from Virginia Woolf's father, Leslie Stephen, on the role of the critic. In it, the correspondent Arthur Rickett derides what he sees as a shortcoming in contemporary criticism, that of the "impressionist" critic. "Literary impressionism is too often only a fine name which covers a multitude of sins—e.g., a smart superficiality of treatment and a straining after cheap paradox" [cite:@rickett1893modern 718].

In /ABC of Reading/, Ezra Pound recommends with a characteristic Poundian enthusiasm "the novels of Henry James, AND especially the prefaces to his collected edition; which are the one extant great treatise on novel writing in English" [cite:@poundABCReading1960 90]. Those prefaces are full of descriptions of James's technique, in which we hear echoes of proto-imagisms and impressionisms. His preface to "The Altar of the Dead," which introduces the New York edition of his 1895 short story collection /Terminations/, describes the "impressions" which drove him to write the story.

"The Altar of the Dead" is a bittersweet story about a couple who become acquainted in a chapel where they have been regularly paying their respects to their recently deceased. It is a pensive, nostalgic story, which, has much in common with James Joyce's story, "The Dead": they are stories in which a couple is haunted by memories of their past loves. These memories James refers to in his preface as "impressions," and they bear distinctly visual qualities: "Other conceits might indeed come and go, born of light impressions and passing hours, for what sort of free intelligence would it be that, addressed to the human scene, should propose to itself, all vulgarly, never to be waylaid or arrested, never effectively insired, by some imaged appeal of the lost Dead?" [cite:@jamesArtNovelCritical1934 242]. The dead appear to James in images and impressions, which are effectuated by light-effects of illumination and shadow: he explains how his story was inspired by a "pair of illuminating incidents," which are etched into his mind, despite the "shadow" of forgetting (242, 245).

** In pedagogy

In /Composition-rhetoric from Literature/, Mooney's taxonomy of description posits /picturesque/ and /impressional/ subtypes. A /picturesque/ description is a "word picture," while an impressional refers to the way "the reader in /imagination/ saw pictures, more or less vivid, of the places, persons, or objects, or he understood the feelings that the sight of these things had aroused in the author or in others who saw them" [cite:@mooney1903composition 81].

She later elaborates: "The terms impressional and dynamic are applied to descriptions producing certain effects on the mind. The sight of an object, a person, a place, or some phenomenon of nature may give the beholder an impression of joyousness, happiness, sorrow, pain, contentment, mystery, hororor, desolation, awe, wretchedness, squalor, magnificence, elegance, purity, goodness, stillness, confusion, power, beauty" [cite:@mooney1903composition 98].

The example Mooney provides is from a description of Rabbi Saunderson's library, from Ian Maclaren's /Kate Carnegie/, one which is remarkably olfactory:

One whiff of its atmosphere as you entered the door gave an appetite and raised the highest expectations. For any bookman can estimate a library by a scent---if an expert, he could even write out a catalogue of the books and sketch the appearance of the owner.

* Image / Imagisms

Literary visualities at the turn of the century are certainly not limited to Imagism, proper. Nor is Imagism the only movement, school, or set of critical principles which enshrines the image. Still, Imagism remains one of the period's most legible set of statements and practices related to image in text, largely due to its rich body of autoexegetic and autotheoretic work. Imagism proper was a short-lived school of British and American poets which lasted for around five years in the 1910s, from the first essays in 1913, to the 1914 anthology /Des Imagistes/, to the last anthology /Some Imagist Poets/ in 1917 [cite:@a1914imagistes;@1915some;@1916some;@1917some]. Despite this short run, it has had a lasting influence.

Imagism has, however, fallen out of style in literary criticism. [[https://openlibrary.org/subjects/imagist_poetry][The book publication history for the LCSH /imagist poetry/, according to Open Library, peaks in about 1970,]] with a significant number of other retrospectives appear in the 1930s. To say that Imagism has mixed reviews would be an understatement. Glen Hughes, in a 1930 retrospective, argues that it "may be characterized as the best-organized and most influential 'movement' in English poetry since the activity of the pre-Raphaelites" [cite:@hughes1972imagism, vii]. Martin Gilkes, writing a year later, calls it "the real beginning of Modern Poetry, the first step towards twentieth-century emancipation" [cite:@gilkes1970key 43]. By the 1970s, however, David Perkins calls imagism "the grammar school of modern poetry, the instruction and drill in basic principles," and it is unclear whether he means this as praise, i.e., that the imagists prepared the way for later poetry, or whether that they are simplistic. Either way, he concedes that they "probably had a more distinct impact than any other group on the style of American poets" [cite:@perkins1976history 329].

Imagist poems draw much of their visual force from two of their most characteristic qualities. The first is their concision, which enables a fragmentary feeling. The second is the implied geographic distance which they uses to evoke a sense of the exotic. I have discussed this socio-cultural distance in the previous chapters, but nowhere is this quality stronger than in these poems. The imagists' exoticisms are further enabled and enacted by the concision, as well: the Imagists' influences in ancient Greek and Japanese poetry, both geographically and temporally distant literatures, lend to Imagist poems their fragmentary quality, as well as their sense of the exotic.

One of their earliest and most well-known Imagist statements is a sequence of two short notes in a 1913 issue of /Poetry/, the first by F.S. Flint, and the second by Ezra Pound [cite:@flint1913]. Flint's begins with the tone of an investigative journalist, hot on the trail of the latest trend: "some curiosity has been aroused concerning /Imagisme/, and as I was unable to find anything definite about it in print, I sought out an /imagiste/, with intent to discover whether the group itself knew anything about the 'movement.' I gleaned these facts" (198--9). The irony is strong for us, and probably for some contemporaneous readers, since we know Flint to be a founding member of the imagists himself. Here, Flint names as imagist influences "the best writers of all time,"---Sappho, Catullus, and Villon. As an unusual selection, it deserves some discussion. First, the poems of Sappho, a Greek poet whose work survives only in fragments, presents a model, however unintentional, of the imagists's fragmentary brevity. Some of her fragments, if treated as intentionally short poems, would be at home in an imagist anthology.

Hugh Kenner treats Sappho's influence, and the fragmentariness of Sappho, on Pound in great detail in /The Pound Era/ [cite:@kennerPoundEra1971]. Kenner shows just how little of some of Sappho's poems survive, and how much imagination would have been required for her imagist admirers. Since auxiliary grammatical structures, and fragments of words, often aren't translated intact, since they don't make much sense outside of their syntactic frame, what gets translated are the nouns, adjectives, and root verbs. In other words, what remains are images. Had Sappho's works survived intact, the imagists wouldn't have celebrated them, since their imagistic qualities are a result of the textual transformations undergone as they deteriorated into fragments, and were translated into smaller fragments.

The next of these influences, Catullus, as a neoteric poet, is known for his choices of quotidian, rather than epic, subjects, similar to those chosen by imagists. His best known work, known as Catullus 64, is told in an ekphrastic mode---a description of an image---and begins with the lines, here translated by Sir Richard Francis Burton in 1894:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Pine-trees gendered whilome upon soaring Peliac summit
Swam (as the tale is told) through liquid surges of Neptune [cite:@catullusValeriusCatullusCarmina]
#+END_VERSE
#+END_QUOTE

This image is virtually identical to that in H.D.'s "Oread," which Pound cited as the exemplary imagist poem:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Whirl up, sea---
whirl your pointed pines,
splash your great pines
on our rocks [cite:1915some 28]
#+END_VERSE
#+END_QUOTE

Catullus, who was also inspired by Sappho, was also well-known for his love poems, known as the "Lesbia poems," many of which are unapologetically sexually explicit, i.e. specific. Richard Aldington quotes from one of these poems in the epigraph of "Daisy," which reprises the theme of Catullus 53 [cite:1915some 13].

Another well-established influence of the imagists was the Japanese poetic form of the haiku. The haiku became popular in Europe around 1900, first in France, and then in Britain. Hiroaki Sato argues that it had a profound influence on European poetry of this time, even attributing to the haiku's influence a "reduced discursiveness in Western poetry" thereafter [cite:@hiroakiHaiku2012]. Haiku are traditionally characterized by the inclusion of a /kigo/, or a textual image which indicates the season: in Japan, this is typically cherry blossoms for the spring, or falling leaves for autumn. Even outside of his translations, buds, petals, and leaves are recurring themes in Pound's poetry.

The haiku evolved from the opening stanza of a /renga/, called a /hokku/, which exhibits the same 17-syllable form. Among some critics, /haiku/ and /hokku/ are seemingly treated as synonyms, but I argue that this distinction is crucial: a /haiku/ stands alone, whereas a /hokku/ is only a small part of a much larger whole. Unlike a /haiku/, a /hokku/ is always already fragmentary.

A frequent character in the modernist little magazines is Yoni Noguchi, an influential Japanese writer who often wrote in English. His work is admiringly reviewed in /The Little Review/ in 1915, and in 1916, he introduced the /hokku/ to readers of /The Egoist/, in a short article called "Seventeen Syllable Hokku Poems" [cite:@andersonLittleReview1915 45; cite:noguchi1916]. It begins, rather poetically for a critical work:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The value of the seventeen-syllable Hokku poem of Japan is not in its physical directness, but in its psychological indirectness. To use a simile, it is like a dew upon lotus leaves of green, or under maple leaves of red, which, although it is nothing but a trifling drop of water, shines, glitters, and sparkles now pearl-white, then amethyst-blue, again ruby-red, according to the time of day and situation" [cite:@noguchi1916 175].
#+END_QUOTE

The visual properties of Noguchi's simile are very prominent, especially the hue. Each of these colors is described using a translucent precious stone of the same color, which constitutes a transformation in hardness from water to stone. Noguchi makes a point to mention that they are a sequence, rather than an assemblage. The scale of this simile is also very small: on the scale of centimeters. As in Pound's early work, leaves abound, and everything is very wet. It is the scale of an object: the scale of that which can be held in the hand.

Noguchi's 1914 book, /The Spirit of Japanese Poetry/ begins with a statement about economy of words that would sound at home in Pound or Lowell:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I come always to the conclusion that the English poets waste too much energy in 'words, words, words,' and make, doubtless with all good intentions, their inner meaning frustrate, at least less distinguished, simply from the reason that its full liberty to appear naked is denied. [cite:@noguchi1914spirit 15].
#+END_QUOTE

One way to read Noguchi's "naked" poetry is as fragmentary: denuded of syntactic function, rhetoric, and performativity. It is specific, and not abstract. Small, and not grandiose. It is no coincidence that Noguchi's negative exemplar is a reference to Hamlet, which Eliot later singles out as a counterexample to his objective correlative.

Rebecca West's 1913 article on Imagism also cites "nakedness" as a feature of good poetry, suggesting that poetry should be stripped of unnecessary clothing with a ruthless austerity:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Poetry should be burned to the bone by austere fires and washed white with rains of affliction: the poet should love nakedness and the thought of the skeleton under the flesh. But because the public will not pay for poetry it has become the occupation of learned persons, given to soft living among veiled things and unaccustomed to being sacked for talking too much. ... But there has arisen a little band who desire the poet to be as disciplined and efficient at his job as the stevedore. Just as Taylor and Gilbreth want to introduce scientific management into industry so the /imagistes/ want to discover the most puissant way of whirling the scattered star dust of words into a new star of passion. [cite:@west1913, 86]
#+END_QUOTE

West's images abound in part-whole relations: burning is a process which transforms single objects into many ashes; skeletons are disconnected assemblages of pieces, in contrast with the continuity of the flesh; and words are fragmentary "scattered star dust" which the poet must "whirl" into a solid "star of passion." Under a cosmological taxonomy, all matter is star dust, but ideas, and the words that approximate them, are immaterial. West's analogy, then, gestures towards the physical, as a remedy to a poetry of abstractions.

Like fragments, ideograms—image-writing said to be expressions of ideas—fascinated the writers of the early twentieth century, especially Pound and the Imagists. Although neither of the most common examples of ideogrammatic writing, ancient Egyptian and Chinese writing, are purely or even mostly ideogrammatic, they were so in the imaginations of many of these writers. Since the /japonismes/ and /chinoiseries/ of the imagists have been well-documented in recent years, [see cite:hayot2009chinese; cite:qian2008ezra; cite:qianOrientalismModernismLegacy1995; and cite:xie2015ezra] I will not continue to document their warped conceptions of the East. However, I would like to contribute to the metadiscourse, by showing how it is the distance, spacial and temporal, to these faraway places that enables their distortion in the imaginations of these poets, and that this imagination is what enables the production of images.

In /ABC of Reading/, a theoretical book of Pound's first published in 1934, but based on earlier writings, he explains what he imagines are the origins of Chinese ideogrammatic characters:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When the Chinaman wanted to make something more complicated, or of a general idea, how did he go about it? He is to define red. How can he do it in a picture that isn't painted in red paint? He puts ... together the abbreviated pictures of ROSE; CHERRY; IRON RUST; FLAMINGO. The Chinese 'word' or ideogram for red is based on something everyone KNOWS. [cite:@poundABCReading1960]
#+END_QUOTE

Pound is likely extrapolatating this from Fenollosa's notes, but has either misinterpreted them, or is himself inventing a folk etymology of the Chinese word for "red." Actually, the character 紅 of 紅色, red, is composed of 糸, a skein of silk, and 工, here used as a phonetic indicator (工, gōng, for 紅, hóng). 糸 was pictogrammatic in its earliest known form, but like many Chinese characters, evolved well beyond representational recognition. This "skein of loose silk" appears in Pound's poem "The Garden," and elsewhere in his work.

Crucially, Pound either doesn't know, or avoids mentioning the phonetic indicators of Chinese writing, probably because it would complicate his "ideogrammatic method," and contradict his view of the Chinese written language "as a medium for poetry," following the title of Fenollosa's treatise [cite:@fenollosa2009chinese]. This is to be expected, since we now know that Pound neither spoke nor read Chinese. Yet this didn't stop him from "translating" a volume of Chinese poetry, /Cathay/, from Li Bai (李白). "Cathay" itself is an archaic term for China, chiefly used in poetry, to denote an exotic, faraway place: it appears as "far Cathay" alongside "Ceylon" and "Inde" in Lord Byron's "Don Juan," for example [cite:@Cathay]. The subtitle of this volume emphasizes this sense of distance Pound sought to evoke, by tracing a long path of the provenance of the original text: "for the most part from the Chinese of Rihaku, from the notes of the late Ernest Fenollosa, and the decipherings of the professors Mori and Ariga." Rather than translating, from the Chinese, however, Pound worked from wordwise literal glosses of individual Chinese characters, as told to the American art historian Ernest Fenollosa by his Japanese tutors.

Pound's quickness to point out the provenance of his text feels anxiously insistent, not unlike the testimonials that accompany nineteenth-century hoax novels. As the only one with access to Fenollosa's notes, Pound becomes the priest with the sole power to "translate" them into poetry---had he worked directly from the Chinese texts, he would've had to have contended with Chinese scholars, who could accurately understand the original. But this marketing ploy seemed to have worked: the celebrity of /Cathay/ is what prompted T.S. Eliot, in his introduction to the 1928 /Selected Poems of Ezra Pound/, to call Pound "the inventor of Chinese poetry for our time" [cite:@PoundSelectedPoems1957]. Ming Xie compellingly glosses Eliot's statement as ambiguous, however: "it could mean either that Pound, equipped with knowledge of Chinese language and literature, single-handedly /created/ Chinese poetry for his contemporaries as a model for poetry, ... or equally that with no knowledge of Chinese at all Pound in fact /invented/, that is 'fabricated,' an image of Chinese poetry that does not correspond to the reality of Chinese poetry" [cite:@xie2015ezra, 223].

The celebration of Chinese writing in /ABC of Reading/, besides being unfaithful to the Chinese language, has the effect of romanticizing, and ultimately dismissing, Chinese poetry. By ignoring the practical aspects of Chinese characters, such as their phonetic indicators, Pound only reinforces the stereotypical conception of Chinese culture as mysterious, spiritual, or symbolic. Chinese writing is not translated, in /Cathay/, but "deciphered," as if it were a secret code, rather than a living language. However, as scholars of Chinese literature are quick to interject, Pound is too easy of a target. The interest of Pound's /Cathay/ is not in its verisimilitude, that is, to its accuracy as translation, but in departure from the originals: in its /imagination/. As such, some of Pound's inventions, or imaginations, exhibit strong visual components. Timothy Billings traces some of Pound's additions to "The City of Choan," for instance, where he adds the word "bright" twice: "the bright cloths and bright caps of Shin" [cite:@pound2018cathay, 18]. The distances to the places Pound describes allows him the freedom to inject his own imaginative visions.

One of the functions of /imagination/, that is, the willing creation of mental images, is to fill the gaps in one's sensory knowledge. Distant places, then---and to a greater degree distant and /inaccessible/ ones, become a matter of imagination, or extrapolation based on limited evidence. Whereas affluent Brits of the early 20th century routinely vacationed on the European continent, the "far" East of China and Japan lived up to its name. This was not due to the raw distance itself, but to the travel time necessary. English-language conceptions of distance are typically physical, and it is only in colloquial speech that they are temporal, in expressions such as "two hours away." One important exception is the isochronic map. As the cartographer John Gordon Bartholemew calculated in his 1914 isochronic map of the world, shown in [cite:@fig:isochroneMap], inland China was in the most inaccessible category of destinations, starting from London. (Another is the Congo of Conrad's /Heart of Darkness/.) While it would take a Londoner at best, 10-20 days to reach Shanghai, the places named in Li Bai could take over 40. By invoking the time-distant, then, Pound evokes an obscurantist epistemology which allows him the space for the intervention of his artistic vision.

#+CAPTION: J. G. Bartholemew, Isochrone Map, 1914
#+LABEL: fig:isochroneMap
[[file:images/1914-isochrone-map.jpg]]

It would have been appealing for Pound to translate poems about these distant places, since so few Europeans would have had direct experience of them. Thus, the imaginative freedom given the writer is broad, and the writing has built-in Brechtian estrangement effects: they are rich with images, since they are products of inventive imaginations. Edward Said, whose influential /Orientalism/ explicitly excludes China and Japan from the category of the oriental, nonetheless writes about this distance in an applicable manner: "imaginative geography and history help the mind to intensify its own sense of itself by dramatizing the distance and difference between what is close to it and what is far away" [cite:@saidOrientalism2014, 55]. Pound dramatizes the distance between London and China, thereby constructing his own identity, by positioning himself as mediator. [fn::For more on Pound and Orientalism, see [cite:@brookerEzraPoundImagism2007 31]]

This exotic distance is illustrated elsewhere in the era's poetry, as well. In 1928, Pound collaborated with Mark van Doren to compile an anthology, /An Anthology of World Poetry/, with additional help from Ford Madox Ford, A.E. Housman, and other poets. This anthology's structure illustrates the imaginative distances---geographic, travel, cultural, and chronological---from its publication place. Van Doren arranges this anthology's poems seemingly in order of this distance from New York: starting with Chinese and Japanese poets, moving to Sanskrit and Persian; then Hebrew, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin; moving through modern European countries; and concluding with English, Irish, and American. Pound's translations appear throughout this anthology: from the Chinese, French, German, and Latin. Only one of his originals is printed, however, "The Garden," which, along with Eliot's "Prufrock" and H.D.'s "Oread," conclude the collection, and the American section, creating the illusion that they are the culmination of this tradition. A number of regions are noticeably absent from this collection, but tellingly, the countries that are included here are ones that are usually cited as influences of the imagists and modernists. One might read van Doren's anthology as retroactively validating the thematic choices of these writers, by painting a picture of the world in which they themselves are the most worldly.

So simplified, however, Pound's version of China, and Chinese languages, is one which he says, in /ABC of Reading/, achieves "the maximum of phanopoeia" [cite:@poundABCReading1960 42]. He immediately glosses this word, which appears to be his own coinage, as that which "throw[s] a visual image on the mind." It derives from ϕανός: light or bright. But it is not just visual content of words that enable this linguistic function. The scene being created must possess a distance which allows for imaginative labor to take place. There are many types of distance beyond the spatio-temporal and travel distances examined here, though: there are also hypo- and hypernym distances between words, which help to create this effect.

** Precision, Specificity, and Scale
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: precision-specificity-and-scale
   :END:

The question of poetic distance is one which is invariably linked to those of specificity and scale. The leaf droplets of Noguchi and Pound are only discernible at a certain distance from the eye: several meters, perhaps, and they are only discernible as such if their boundaries may be visually detected such that they correspond to a certain lexical category. In a much-quoted passage from an early imagist manifesto, Flint lays out the "few rules, drawn up for their own satisfaction only," which the imagists had devised: "1. Direct treatment of the 'thing,' whether subjective or objective. 2. To use absolutely no word that did not contribute to the presentation. 3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome" (199). The first I take to mean, an ekphrastic mode in which there is little permeability between the metaphor and the emotion whose traditional, abstracted designations it illustrates. The second describes not only an economy of language, but a prohibition of certain categories of words, namely those which have no visual component. And /Presentation/ here is antecedent to re-presentation, and is a rhetoric of directness which elides agency: presentation is not fabrication, it argues, it is merely showing what is already there. This is a realist stance, or in Barthes's term a "reality effect" which minimizes the role of the poet's imagination in the creation of the image [cite:@barthes1989bruissement]. These effects depend on notions of lexical specificity.

The essay that follows this manifesto of Flint's in /Poetry/ is Ezra Pound's "A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste," an imagist /via negativa,/ in which Pound largely defines the school according to what it is not---in Pound's terms, in "Mosaic negative." In it, he defines an "image" as "that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time" [cite:@pound1913 200]. This definition of image reveals a temporal component of the imagist conception of the image: an image presents not only an arrangement of objects or words, as a still-life painting might, but a frozen moment---a photograph or a film still, a dynamic scene rendered static. Pound goes on to specify that he uses the term "complex" "rather in the technical sense employed by the newer psychologists, such as Hart" (200). The British psychologist Bernard Hart, in his work /The Psychology of Insanity/ which appeared the previous year, explains the complex as "a system of connected ideas, with a strong emotional tone, and a tendency to produce actions of a certain definite character" [cite:@hart1912psychology 61]. The example Hart gives, tellingly, is a photography hobby which is driven by a "photography complex" (62).

As elsewhere in imagist propaganda, Pound defines this movement in terms of other media, and other genres. First, he cautions poets, "don't be descriptive; remember that a painter can describe a landscape much better than you can, and that he has to know a deal more about it" (203). It is unclear here whether Pound means that a painting "describes" a landscape, metaphorically, or that a painter, having painted the landscape, can describe it in prose much better than the poet. At a basic level, it is hard for writing, imagist or otherwise, to avoid description in the strict sense of the word, when one of its primary processes is the conversion of visual information into text---a process necessarily involving description. But what Pound seems to mean by "description" here is closer to verbosity, or prosaic, adjective-laden ekphrasis. Yet paradoxically, Pound does not eschew prose, but aligns himself with it: "Don't retell in mediocre verse what has already been done in good prose. Don't think any intelligent person is going to be deceived when you try to shirk all the difficulties of the unspeakably difficult art of good prose by chopping your composition into line lengths" (201--2). This attention to generic distinctions---and to blurring them---is one which we shall see appear again and again in the writers I discuss below.

Later in Pound's essay, he repeats Flint's trio of imagist rules: linguistic precision, directness, and irregular rhythm. The following year, after Pound's leadership in the group was replaced with Amy Lowell's, she, too, lists rules, but ones that have been modified somewhat, and to which three more have been added. Lowell repeats the goals of rhythmic innovation, and of image "presentation." To this, she adds that "we are not a school of painters, but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities" [cite:1915some vii]. Here again is an intermedial analogy, however, strangely, it is not the modern art of Wyndham Lewis, or the impressionism that inspired early Hulme, that provides the referent, but presumably a genre which values faithful representation.

"Exactitude," to Lowell, may be a matter of language economy, but may also speak to specificity and to scale. First, using the exact word might mean that one has hit the target in one shot, and can therefore stop shooting. However, since Lowell goes on to explain that "exact" means not "merely decorative," we can infer that "exact" here means something closer to "utilitarian." But what would constitute a "decorative" word? "Exact" might also refer to specificity---in linguistic terms, the hypernym level in the lexical hierarchy: /fir/, rather than /tree/. Specificity, then, is related somewhat to scale: /bough/ instead of /tree/: a part-meronymic relation.

# TODO: explain these categories better

"We oppose the cosmic poet," Lowell announces, on grounds of imprecision (vii). Imprecision here is a matter of scale. The astronomical scale is one which Lowell considers irrelevant to her, and the imagists' poetic interests. Several months later, in a special issue on imagism in /The Egoist/, Harold Monro accuses the poets of the school as being "so terrified at Cosmicism that they ran away into a kind of exaggerated Microcosmicism, and found their greatest emotional excitement in everything that seemed intensely small" [cite:@monro1915 78]. This critique is seemingly confirmed by the first poem in the anthology, Richard Aldington's "Childhood," whose central simile is that of a "chrysalis in a match-box" [cite:1915some 3]. Yet, the same poem parodoxically begins on what one might call a cosmic scale: "the wretchedness of childhood / Put me out of love with God. / I can't believe in God's goodness; / I can believe / In many avenging gods." Although the speaker of Aldington's poem repudiates the cosmic, he engages with it still.

It is an unanswered question whether Aldington, or any of the imagists, are really concerned with small things, whether they only seem so in contrast to prior poets, or whether they are in fact more concerned with the cosmos as their predecessors. An unanswered, perhaps, but not unanswerable question. Furthermore, we might ask: just how small is small? How do we know what a small object is, and what a big object is? Are these sizes relative to the size of human body? If so, which human bodies, precisely? When---under what circumstances, and at what sizes---does an object stop becoming an /thing/ and become a collection of things, or a even a /place/? Scale is an important visual component of writing in this period, since it speaks to manipulability: what is small is smaller than a human. An object is typically small, since it can be held in the hand, and it must be of this scale in order to be moved, and movement is what gives it boundaries which make it discernible as an object in the first place, which is what gives it a word.

There are other physical or visual properties that Lowell here uses to describe the work in the second imagist anthology. One of the goals of the imagists, she says, is "to produce poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite." This word "hard" appears often in imagist rhetoric, and so it bears unpacking. While "hard" is obviously meant to be the opposite of "indefinite," as it is used in phrases like "hard left turn," "hard liquor," or "hard shadow," it also recalls physical properties of objects, like solidity, which Lowell might place opposite to conceptual ethereality. Solidity is one of the properties which help to endow objects with objecthood: water and sand are not objects, and do not take indefinite articles, since they do not cohere enough to be handled as such.

In 1918, Pound publishes an article in /Poetry/ called "The Hard and Soft in French Poetry" in which he explains these terms somewhat [cite:@ezra1954literary 285]. I say "somewhat" because his explanation is vague: "by 'hardness' I mean a quality which is in poetry nearly always a virtue," he begins, " ... by softness I mean an opposite quality which is not always a fault." He continues, "anyone who dislikes these textural terms may lay the blame on Théophile Gautier, who certainly suggests them in /Emaux et Camées/; it is his hardness that I had first in mind. He exorts us to cut in hard substance, the shell and the Parian." He then goes on to name who, in French or, more often, in English poetry, who is "hard" and who is "soft": "since Gautier, Corbière has been hard, not with a glaze or parian finish, but hard like weather-bit granite. ... Romains, Vildrac, Spire, Arcos, are not hard, any one of them" (288). At no point in the essay does he explain these terms further.

Peter Nicholls sees the "hardness" of Pound and Lowell as "a stylistic and ethical feature of verse that represents a challenge to poetic convention: '‘Gautier is intent on being ‘hard': is intent on conveying a certain verity of feeling, and he ends by being truly poetic" [cite:@nichollsHardSoftModernism2013 285]. For Nicholls, "hardness" is a political stance, as well, where hardness "begins to attach itself to apparently incontestable ideological 'verities,' while 'softness' connotes a mythic, pre-political world where 'musical' values hold sway" (ibid.). I would agree that the resort to physical, textural properties among the imagists is a depoliticizing rhetoric, but the it also speaks to ambiguity and specificity: that which is "soft" is pliable, ambiguous, and general; what is "hard" is lexically specific and small.

One of Pound's examples of "hardness" is a few lines from Pierre-Joséph Bernard, an erotic poet, "praised by Voltaire," whom he explains has "clear hard little stanzas." The lines are from "l'Art d'aimer":

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
    J'au vu Daphné, Terpsichore légère,
      Sur un tapis de rose et de fougère,
      S'abandonner à des bonds pleins d'appas,
    Voler, languir... [cite:@ezra1954literary 286]
  #+END_VERSE
#+END_QUOTE

Since the form and subject matter of this passage are so /légère/, its "hardness" is not easily identifiable. Pound might refer to the density, or in Lowell's phrase, "concentration" of the verses: the ratio of images or visual information carried to the syntax that carries them.

There is a distinct Hellenism in this passage that is also worth noting. In Ovid, Daphne, a river nymph who is the object of Apollo's cupid-crazed affections, transforms into a tree to escape his amorous grasp. In Bernard's modernization, Daphne's flora appear as the rose and fern designs on the rug on which she dances. The story is the subject of many neoclassical artworks, most notably Bernini's 1625 sculpture /Apollo and Daphne/, which is almost photographic in the way it captures an instant of motion.

One of the keys to understanding Lowell and Pound's "hardness" is in this continued association with Greek marble sculpture. Parian marble---mined from a quarry on Paros---is famous for its flawlessness. When Pound derided Edward Storer's poetry as "custard" in comparison with H.D.'s "Hellenic hardness," he might have had this marble in mind [cite:@jones2001imagist 22]. H.D.'s own poetic themes certainly confirm both this Hellenism and sculptural qualities: her first poem in the second imagist anthology begins, "you are clear, / O rose, cut in rock, / hard as the descent of hail" [cite:1915some 22]. In fact, this substance is a favorite of imagists more generally, and appears again in Richard Aldington's poem "To a Greek Marble," the second poem in the first imagist anthology: "White grave goddess, / Pity my sadness, / O silence of Paros" [cite:@a1914imagistes, 10]. The solidity, hardness, of the marble is what gives it objecthood, and distinguishes it from custard. It is also what makes it an /image/, that is, a word possessing definite visual properties.

There is a gendered dimension to this sculptural theme that deserves discussion. Rachel DuPlessis and others have noted that Pound's love poems, as well as those of other imagists, follow the genre of an ode to one's muse. The muse---less the Greek goddesses of the arts, in this sense, and more generally objects of affection---is, according to Jed Rasula's theory in /Gendering the Muse/, "the site of a poet's own embedded otherness," representing not the woman, but the poet's own romanticizations [cited in cite:duplessisPropoundingModernistMaleness2002, 390]. Like a marble statue, the muse-ode genre freezes the usually female amorous object in place, almost photographically, and strips her of qualities other than her appearance. It puts the poet's lover on a pedestal, figuratively speaking, just as the sculptor does, literally.

The term which accompanies "hard" in Pound and Lowell is "clear." Parian marble is clear of imperfections, and so there is a sense in which "clear" means "pure," although that again a romanticization and a misunderstanding of the past: Greek statues, in their original contexts, would have been painted with bright colors, and wouldn't have been white, as they now appear in museums. "Pure white," of course, has a distinctly fascist ring to it, and this is only underscored by Pound's own history as a fascist and anti-Semitic radio broadcaster, and so it would not be far-fetched to read "clear" as proto-fascist. But to highlight again the surface meaning of the term, and to make the best guess at what Lowell means here, "clear" would be closer to lexical specificity. Lowell chooses a visual metaphor, where objects are visible when they're focused by the mind's eye. "Clear" can also mean "transparent," or "unclouded," which leads us to associate poetic murkiness with abstraction. Going further, we might posit that clarity speaks to a richness of visual properties which can be inferred from the specificities of certain nouns and adjectives.

These ideas do not originate with Pound and Lowell, but appear in the works of the philosopher-poet T.E. Hulme, who is often named as the spiritual "father of imagism" [cite:@hughes1972imagism 9]. A notorious anti-authoritarian, Hulme was famously "sent down" from Cambridge for unspecified "disturbances" [cite:@jones2001imagist 161-2]. His "Notes on Language and Style," which was probably written in 1907, was published posthumously in 1925 (224). There, we find Hulme using "firm" and "solid" as descriptors for the kinds of books he promotes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Rising disgust and impatience with the talking books, e.g. Lilly and the books about Life, Science, and Religion. All the books which seem to be the kind of talk one could do if one wished. Rather choose those in old leather, which are /solid/. Here the man did not talk, but saw solid, definite things and described them. Solidity a pleasure. [cite:@hulme98_selec 39]
#+END_QUOTE

Hulme contrasts "solidity" with "talk," which supports a reading of "hard" as not the opposite of "soft," but terse, economical. Unlike Pound, he does not reject description, but sees the writing process---at least that of "the man" who writes leatherbound books---as a process which begins with visual experience, is cognitively categorized into "definite things," and ends with description. In contrast, "talk," for Hulme, is language which is abstracted, and at a remove from, sensory experience. He later explains this process in mathematical terms:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ...in algebra, the real things are replaced by symbols. These symbols are manipulated according to certain laws which are independent of their meaning. ... An analogous phenomenon happens in reasoning in language. We replace meaning (i.e. /vision/) by words. These words fall into well-known patterns, i.e. into certain well-known phrases which we accept without thinking of their meaning, just as we do the /x/ in algebra. [cite:@hulme98_selec 37]
#+END_QUOTE

Hulme equates "meaning" with "vision," implying a primacy of visual experiences in the constructions of words. He also attributes clichés to habit and to thinking which takes place at a remove from vision. Later, he draws the distinction between /rhetoric/ and /solid vision/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  All emotion depends on real solid vision or sound. It is physical. But in /rhetoric/ and expositional prose we get words divorced from any real vision. Rhetoric and emotion---here the connection is different. So perhaps literary expression is from /Real/ to /Real/ with all the intermediate forms keeping their /real/ value." (38)
#+END_QUOTE

Hulme's conception of /rhetoric/ seems to be a teleological, pragmatic prose which he opposes with an ateleological, or autotelic art centered around visual experience. Its use as a pejorative term among the imagists is treated at length in John Gage's work on imagist rhetoric, and may be traced at least to Yeats's essay, "Emotion of Multitude," in which he famously calls rhetoric "the will trying to do the work of the imagination" [cite:@gageArrestingEyeRhetoricc1981; cite:yeatsEssaysIntroductions1961, 215].

Like Pound, Hulme finds that prose is typically more aligned with his ideal poetic criteria than Romantic poetry.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The contrast between (i) a firm simple prose, creating in a definite way a fairy story, a story of simple life in the country ... Here we have the microcosm of poetry. The pieces picked out from which it comes. Sun and sweat and all of them. Physical life and death fairies. And (ii) on the other hand, genteel poetry like Shelley's, which refers in elaborate analogies to the things mentioned in (i). (39)
#+END_QUOTE

His use of "physical" is unusual for imaginary beings, but the paradox highlights the importance, for Hulme's poetics, of writing that evokes physical properties, meaning, usually, visual properties, as well: "sun" and "sweat" are not merely emblems---of happiness, hard work, or otherwise---but have discernible sizes, colors, and other visual properties.

In a later essay, "Romanticism and Classicism," probably written around 1911, Hulme draws the distinction between the two eponymous forces that he sees as opposing factors in cultural history. "After a hundred years of romanticism," he begins, "we are in for a classical revival" (71). Here, he disparages the habits of "the romantic," who, "because he thinks man is infinite, must always be talking about the infinite ... The word infinite is in every other line. ... In the classical attitude you never seem to swing right along to the infinite nothing" (71-2). Hulme might object to the use of the word "infinite" on grounds that the scale is irrelevant to human concerns, or that it's difficult to visualize: it has no visual properties.

** Dry and Wet
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dry-and-wet
   :END:

In "Romanticism and Classicism," Hulme refers to the "classical attitude," in terms Pound would later adopt, as having "dry hardness":

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  How many people now can lay their hands on their hearts and say they like either Horace or Pope? They feel a kind of chill when they read them. The dry hardness which you get in the classics is absolutely repugnant to them. Poetry that isn't damp isn't poetry at all. They cannot see that accurate description is a legitimate object of verse. Verse to them always means a bringing in of some of the emotions that are grouped round the word infinite. (75)
#+END_QUOTE

The "dry" / "damp" dichotomy here introduces a new figuratively physical set of poetic properties, as Hulme sees them. "Dry," when used of writing, usually means "boring": technical manuals are "dry." The OED gives, in sense 17 for "dry,": "deficient in interest; unattractive, distasteful, insipid. (figurative from food that wants succulency.)" [cite:@DryAdjAdv]. Yet Hulme is certainly not suggesting that writing should be boring, or distasteful. Instead, the liquid, in his metaphor, emotion, abstraction, or unnecessary ambiguity: factors that inhibit the transference or translation of a mental image from poet to reader.

As Sarah Barnsley points out, Pound's poetry does not follow this stricture, since a common theme of his is wetness. Whereas Barnsley identifies in H.D. pervasive imagery of dryness, such as dry sand, she catalogues several instances in Pound of wet botanical imagery, namely, "a wet leaf that clings to the threshold," ("Lie Ch'e"), "the petal fall in the fountain," ("Ts'au Chi'h"); "petals on a wet, black bough" ("in a Station of the Metro"); "as cool as the pale wet leaves" ("Alba"), and "the dew is upon the leaf" ("Coitus") [cite:@barnsleyMaryBarnardAmerican2013 45]. In contrast to Pound, she concludes, H.D. "fashions a feminine sphere through imagery of hard, dry textures that find no correlation in the damp, soft textures styling Pound's Imagist sphere at this time" (ibid.). While there is some truth to this gendering of dry and wet among the imagists, I would like to emphasize its physical, and thus visual, properties. The imagery of wetness---and especially wet foliage---likely has its origin in the climate of Japan. Since southern Japan experiences an annual "wet" or rainy season, and that season is invariably accompanied with the blossoming of flowers, this image is the /kigo/ which signifies the season.

In more visual terms, wetness, as we have seen in Noguchi, is that which creates a scintillating visual effect: when things are wet, they sparkle. Thus, Noguchi's comparison of water droplets to precious stones is one that---on the surface---compares similar phenomena of light [cite:@noguchi1916 175].

** Image and Symbol; Image and Rhetoric
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: image-and-symbol-image-and-rhetoric
   :END:

The imagists are quick to assert that images are not symbols, even when they still operate as signifiers. And Hulme is insistent on a dichotomy between images and rhetoric, even while blurring that distinction in practice. The symbolic order is never completely escapable in writing, since language itself is a set of symbols. Given that premise, imagist rhetoric feels at best naive, and at worst a failed marketing ploy. But it is for this reason that the boundaries between images and symbols deserve exploration.

To trace the genealogy of the image/symbol dichotomy even further, Hulme's major philosophical influence, a French thinker whose books he often translated and reviews, was Henri Bergson. Besides being a well known and widely read philosopher of the period, his ideas appear often in the essays of this period's literary writers [cite:@gilliesHenriBergsonBritish1996]. It is probably from Bergson, in fact, that Hulme derives his ideas of instantaneity, and circumvention of the symbol in art. In Hulme's translation of Bergson's /An Introduction to Metaphysics/, we see this "direct treatment of the thing" explained:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If there exists any means of possessing a reality absolutely instead of knowing it relatively, of placing oneself within it instead of looking at it from outside points of view, of having the intuition instead of making the analysis: in short, of seizing it without any expression, translation, or symbolic representation---metaphysics is that means. /Metaphysics, then, is the science which claims to dispense with symbols./ [cite:@bergsonIntroductionMetaphysics1912 9, emphasis in the original.]
#+END_QUOTE

We hear in Bergson's metaphysics an attempt to escape the symbolic order through direct experience, direct "knowing" of "a reality," and direct "seizing" it, without mediation. It is /unmediated/, therefore /immediate/; /instant/, therefore /simultaneous/. His aesthetic theory, or theory of perception more generally, depends on the conception of subjectivities of time for which he is famous: the /temps / durée/ dichotomy. Later, Bergson, through Hulme, explains his notion of the image, in similarly temporal terms:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Now the image has at least this advantage, that it keeps us in the concrete. No image can replace the intuition of duration, but many diverse images, borrowed from different orders of things, may, by the convergence of their action, direct consciousness to the precise point where there is a certain intuition to be seized. By choosing images as dissimilar as possible, we shall prevent any one of the from usurping the place of the intuition it is intended to call up, since it would then be driven away at once by its rivals." (ibid. 16)
#+END_QUOTE

Images are only discernible, Bergson seems to say, through contrast with their surroundings, and with each other. Though their dissimilarities, they produce an effect of immediacy, which Hulme echoes, then Pound, and then Eliot and other writers of this period.

#  Bergson, Hulme on image sequences

Many of the imagists' conceptions of the image may also be traced to the French writer and critic Remy de Gourmont, whose work was often featured alongside imagists in /The Egoist/. In a 1915 article in /The Fortnightly Review/, Pound praises his "intelligence" for its "limpidity and fairness and graciousness, and irony, and a sensuous charm in his decoration when he chose to make his keen thought flash out against a richly-colored background" [cite:@poundSelectedProse190919651973 413-23]. Although Pound does nod to Gourmont's attention to the senses, it is somewhat parodoxical, or at least self-contradictory, for Pound that he would praise anyone's writerly "decoration," after rejecting said decoration just previously in his writings on imagism. Richard Aldington, in a later review, praises him not for his use of images, by for the ways in which his philosophy permeates his creating writing. But most of all, Aldington highlights his antiauthoritarianism: his "philosophic anarchism," which was "too far-seeing to become imprisoned in a system" [cite:@richardaldingtonLiteraryStudiesReviews1924 169]. "His thought," he warns, "is a kind of pungent acid under whose action social humbugs and moral shams dissolve." The force of this praise is the kind that lends credence to readings of these early modernist writers as proto-fascists. Yet Aldington, the imagists, and this period of literary history, see in Gourmont a figure whose thought promises the decisive break with tradition they wanted, and the fault lines for that break grow in the realms of the visual.

Gourmont's own description of his writing, and his instructions for good writing, is not only much more subdued, but helps to shed light on its visual properties, and the intermedial metaphors he requires to describe them:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Écrire bien, avoir du style, ... user d'un style « descriptif ou de couleur », c'est peindre. La faculté maîtresse du style, c'est donc la mémoire visuelle. Si l'écrivain ne voit pas ce qu'il décrit, ce qu'il raconte, paysages et figures, mouvements et gestes, comment aurait-il du style, c'est-à-dire, en somme, de l'originalité? Le peintre qui travaille « de chic » a devant les yeux la scène imaginaire qu'il traduit à mesure. De fort belles oeuvres ont été faites ainsi. Qui dit peintre, dit visuel. [cite:@de1916problème]

  [To write well, to have style, ... to use a descriptive or colorful style, is to paint. The mastery of style, therefore, is the visual memory. If the writer doesn't see what he describes, what he recounts, landscapes and figures, movements and gestures, how can he have style, which is to say, originality? The painter who works fashionably has before his eyes the imaginary schene which he translates. He then paints strongly beautiful works as a result. He who talks of painting, talks of the visual.]
#+END_QUOTE
 # TODO: Get non-breaking spaces around quotation marks

Writing as painting, or more specifically, /describing/ as painting, is an old an often-used analogy, but one which takes on new meaning in the age of such schools of painting as abstract expressionism and post-impressionism. /Chez les imagistes/, it is no longer the writer's job to faithfully represent the visual experience of the narration, but just /a/ visual experience, one which evokes the emotion felt by the writer. These are symbols, of course, but they are symbols that pretend to be perfect substitutes for the thing-in-itself.

Imagist rhetoric borrows heavily from the French symbolists of a decade or two earlier. In fact, the repeated imagist insistence that they are /not/ symbolists is probably the clearest indication that they are [cite:@taupinInfluenceFrenchSymbolism1985]. Like the imagists, they also published a manifesto: "The Symbolist Manifesto," Jean Moréas wrote and published in /Le Figaro/ in 1886. In it, he declares symbolist poetry to be "ennemie de l'enseignement, de la déclamation, de la fausse sensibilité, de la description objective," [enemy of pedagogy, declaration, false sensibility, and objective description] and that it looks to "vêtir l'Idée d'une forme sensible qui, néanmoins, ne serait pas son but à elle-même, mais qui, tout en servant à exprimer l'Idée, demeurerait sujette [clothe the idea in a sensory form which, nevertheless, would not be an end in itself, but which, in service of the expression of the Idea, would remain the subject] [cite:@vanierPremieresArmesSymbolisme1889 33-4].

Although symbolism is against "objective description," it yet seeks to convey ideas through the use of symbols and objects: symbolist poetry is ideas clothed in the /sensory/. Pound insists that "imagism is not symbolism," but the image as vehicle for emotion is suspiciously analogous to the symbol as clothes for the idea. In fact, much of what Flint says of imagism in /Poetry/ he says of Symbolism earlier the same year. In his essay, "Contemporary French Poetry," he calls symbolism "a contempt for the wordy flamboyance of the romanticists" [cite:@flintContemporaryFrenchPoetry1912, 355]. "Flamboyance" recalls Pound and Lowell's "ornament" or "decoration": words that can be removed without changing the meaning of the poem, or words which contribute nothing to the aim of the poem.

William Butler Yeats, an inspiration to the imagists, and with whom Pound worked closely, often writes of poetic practice in terms of its sister arts, or using analogies derived from the plastic arts. In an early essay, "What is Popular Poetry?", he writes of his desire for a new national poetry, "which would not be an English style and yet would be musical and full of colour" [cite:@yeatsEssaysIntroductions1961 3]. What Yeats means by "colour" here might be closer to its use in the expression "local color," rather than literal colors, but it still speaks to a visual dimension to his ideal poetry. In a later essay, "The Symbolism of Poetry," Yeats praises Arthur Symons's critical work, /The Symbolist Movement in Literature,/ a seminal work for many imagists. In it, he shows what he means by "symbolism," and illustrates it with two lines from Burns: "the white moon is setting behind the white wave, / and Time is setting with me, O!". Those lines, he claims,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  are perfectly symbolical. Take from them the whiteness of the moon and of the wave, whose relation to the setting of Time is too subtle for the intellect, and you take from them their beauty. But, when all are together, moon and wave and whiteness and setting Time and the last melancholy cry, they evoke an emotion which cannot be evoked by any other arrangement of colours and sounds and forms. We may call this metaphorical writing, but it is better to call it symbolical writing, because metaphors are not profound enough to be moving, when they are not symbols, and when they are symbols they are the most perfect of all... [cite:@yeatsEssaysIntroductions1961 155-6]
#+END_QUOTE

While "whiteness" is not /entirely/ too subtle for the intellect---it recalls the white hair of old age, for one---it shows that, for Yeats, the visual properties of poetic images are what allow them convey the otherwise ineffable, and what allow them to draw analogies across unrelated domains. This is the same phenomenon Woolf hints at with her properties of "thought," and toys with the properties of the visual realm as are, and as they appear: in both their subjective and objective senses.

** Subjective and Objective
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: subjective-and-objective
   :END:

Parian marble is an object: an object of the gaze, but also a grammatical object. Although Flint's first dictum, "direct treatment of the thing, whether subjective or objective," appears to take no stance in this dichotomy, T.S. Eliot does. An influential poet/critic of this period, and a friend of Pound, Woolf, and other imagists, T.S. Eliot reviews J.M. Robertson's /The Problem of Hamlet/ in 1919, and sketches his theory of the "objective correlative," a notion which shares properties with the imagist "image" [cite:@eHamletHisProblems1919]. Scholars have often noted that Eliot's is by no mean a new conception, as it is found in many other critics and philosophers, but has a few unique properties [cite:@frankEliotObjectiveCorrelative1972 311]. In his essay, Eliot contrasts these lines of Hamlet, Act I---"look, the morn, in russet mantle clad / Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill"---with a few "quite mature" but "unstable" lines from Act V---"Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting / that would not let me sleep" [cite:@eHamletHisProblems1919 941]. The latter is probably what he earlier calls Shakespeare's "superfluous and inconsistent scenes which even hasty revision should have noticed." This is pure imagism. Its insistence on revision for concision, distaste for abstractions (if we read "instable" as opposite to "concrete") and preference for visual information are all found in the imagist propaganda of Pound, Flint, and Lowell. Furthermore, the quote from Hamlet is also Pound's, from "A Few Don'ts." Although where Pound doesn't quite get the quote right, revising it to "dawn in russet mantle clad," Eliot does. They both, however, attribute these lines to "Shakespeare," rather than to his character Horatio, effectively hiding an easy explanation for the contrast between these two passages: differences in character speech patterns---Hamlet is much more given to abstraction than Horatio.

In explaining his reasons for what he considers the "failure" of Hamlet, Eliot announces that:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an "objective correlative"; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that /particular/ emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked." (941)
#+END_QUOTE

Again, we hear the echo of Pound's theory of images as emotional expressions, and Pound and Lowell's calls for particularity. Perhaps more importantly, we see the expansion of the imagist definition of Pound's to include "events," which adds a Bergsonian temporal dimension to the earlier notion of image. In an almost desperate attempt to avoid the symbol, or figurativity more generally, Eliot insists that "language in a healthy state presents the object, is so close to the object that the two are identical" [quoted in @gageArrestingEyeRhetoricc1981, 3). It is impossible for an object and its linguistic representation to be identical, but this is a rhetorical move which shows Eliot gesturing towards a surface reading, /avant la lettre/. Put differently, he wants us to /see/ the object as rendered in text for what it is, rather than dismissing it as merely a signifier that points to some greater abstraction.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
  Pound anthologized James Joyce's poem "I Hear an Army" in *Des Imagistes*, making him an imagist after the fact. An eerie coincidence is that, although the army of its title is only metaphorical, and dreamlike, the anthology was published in February 1914, just four months before the outbreak of the first world war. The poem was reprinted from Joyce's 1907 collection, *Chamber Music*, where is is not titled, but numbered. In an untitled fragment from a notebook from a few years prior, Joyce muses on the relation of the image with art, both plastic and literary, using a quasi-Vergilian taxonomy:

  > There are three conditions of art: the lyrical, the epical and the dramatic. That art is lyrical whereby the artist sets forth the image in immediate relation to himself; that art is epical whereby the artist sets forth the image in mediate relation to himself and others: that art is dramatic whereby the artist sets forth the image in immediate relation to others. [cite:@joyceCriticalWritings2018 122-3]

  These "conditions" of art all share the task of the artist setting forth the image.

  By this definition, imagism sees itself as lyric, with images presented in immediate relation to the artist. The Bergsonian immediacy is present here again. Joyce's use of "sets forth" also recalls Pound's "presents": the aim of the poet is not to interpret, to persuade, or to orate, but merely to *set forth*. This does not, and cannot, obviate mediation, or symbolic functions, but it is a stance toward that process which seeks to hide it.

** Persistence of Vision: Cinema and Photography; the Static and the Dynamic.
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: persistence-of-vision-the-static-and-the-dynamic
 :END:

Visual perception of movement, or "vibration" as Conrad puts it, depends on an ocular phenomenon known as persistence of vision. While this phenomenon has been well-known for centuries, it only began to be studied in earnest in the latter part of the 19th century. As one researcher defines it in 1898: "the retina of the human eye retains the impression of an object for a short time after the object itself has been withdrawn" [cite:@bruceProjectionLuminousObjects1898 201]. Were it not for this neurological effect, he continues, "the rain-shower would be falling drops, not lines of water; the meteor in the skies would be bereft of its glories, being merely a fiery ball, leaving no glittering path behind it" (202).

The relation between a series of images and their perceived motion is complex, and analogous to the serialization and deserialization process of reading described in the previous chapter: discrete images, if shown in rapid succession, create the illusion of continuous motion, and continuous motion may be losslessly (to borrow a term from information theory) discretized into individual images. This is the principle on which the technology of the cinema depends: to be perceived as motion, the photographs that comprise a motion picture must be projected at a rate of at least 10-12 per second. The modern frame rate for films is around 24 frames per second, but it varied in early films, from about 16 to 24 [cite:@neumeyerOxfordHandbookFilm2014 588]. Since writing is by nature discrete and serial, this phenomenon is an apt metaphorical lens through which to understand turn of the century writing.

As I have argued in the previous chapter, lexical ambiguities surrounding the image are manifest in the blossoming variety of media available in the early 20th century. However, to accept this ambiguity with problematizing it, is to ignore the nuanced properties of the textual image /as/ untranslated and untranslatably textual, rather than merely a representation of the visual. Ekphrastic readings, at their most fundamental, figure textual images as derivative of prior visual phenomena, such as works of visual art. Similarly, intermedial approaches, which draw on parallels between modernist works across media, risk eliding their textual pecularities. Here, I hope to unpack the affordances of the textual medium as a vehicle of image transmission.

Writing and cinema were never far apart among the high modernists. James Joyce briefly interrupted his self-imposed exile on the continent to attempt to open a cinema in Dublin, in 1909 [cite:@attridge_cambridge_2004 xv]. And as Christopher Butler compellingly argues, the simultaneity of the "Wandering Rocks" episode of /Ulysses/ might owe its technique to the montage of filmmakers such as Eisenstein, with whom Joyce was in contact. Virginia Woolf's 1926 essay "The Cinema," although it begins by discussing the then-new artistic medium, spends more time discussing fiction. She is interested here in interfaces between thought and image, imaginal image and literary image:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  For what characteristics does thought possess which can be rendered visible to the eye without the help of words? It has speed and slowness; dart-like directness and vaporous circumlocution. But it has also an inveterate tendency especially in moments of emotion to make images run side by side with itself, to create a likeness of the thing thought about, as if by so doing it took away its sting, or made it beautiful and comprehensible. In Shakespeare, as everybody knows, the most complex ideas, the most intense emotions form chains of images, through which we pass, however rapidly and completely they change, as up the loops and spirals of a twisting stair. [cite:@woolf2009selected 252-3]
#+END_QUOTE

Here, for Woolf, literary art serializes what thought presents in parallel: it transforms images that "run side by side" with thought into "chains of images." Woolf's spiral staircase analogy illustrates this serialization, using a favorite image of Yeats's, whose house, a rennovated Norman tower, prominently featured one; his /The Winding Stair and Other Poems/ would be published in 1933. Yeats was also partial to the image of the gyre and to the cone, which derive from a theory of history he explains in /A Vision/. Pound and Wyndham Lewis, too, published the manifesto of their "Vorticist" movement only a few years earlier, one which takes as its central symbol a similar image: the vortex. Vortices, spirals, and other such symbols, are at once linear and recurrent: they repeat themselves, but with a difference. Vortices and spiral staircases are at once dizzying and transporting. Nico Israel treats this recurring symbol at length in his /Spirals/, where he argues that, "embodying tensions between teleology and cyclicality, repetition and difference, locality and globality, spirals challenge familiar modes of organizing disciplines of study" [cite:@israel15_spiral 2].

Woolf returns to this metaphor in her later essay, "How Should One Read a Book," referring again to the images of Shakespeare. Here, though, she elaborates on the quality of the image:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
reading poetry often seems a state of rhapsody ... and we read on, understanding with the senses, not with the intellect, in a state of intoxication. Yet all this intoxication and intensity of delight depend upon the exactitude and truth of the image, on its being the counterpart of the reality within. Remote and extravagant as some of Shakespeare's images seem, far-fetched and etheral as some of Keats's, at the moment of reading they seem the cap and culmination of the thought; its final expression. [cite:@woolf2009selected 131-2]
#+END_QUOTE

Woolf's descriptors, "exactitude and truth," convey an almost scientific tone, and echo the imagist rhetoric of Ezra Pound and F.S. Flint, as we will see below. This conceives of literary representation as one more aligned with photography than painting. The ambiguity in /truth/, both the opposite of a lie and an arrow's true flight, allows Woolf to hint that the literary image should be both representationally accurate to the thought or emotion, and mimetically accurate to the real-world referent. And as in T.S. Eliot's objective correlative, the image is that which corporializes the thought for Woolf---gives it body. Woolf's terms for Shakepeare's images, "remote" and "extravagant," depend on a notion of distance which is built into the concept of the mental image, or the image-making process, imagination.

Woolf's "truth" as accuracy appears also in Conrad, who, in a letter to H.G. Wells in 1905 congratulating him for his /A Modern Utopia/, says that, as a novelist, he "must speak in images," rather than abstractions [cite:@aubryJosephConradLife1927, 16]. In another letter, where Conrad gives writing advice to R. B. Cunninghame Graham, he warns, "I don't start with an abstract notion. I start with definite images and as their rendering is true some little effect is produced" [cite:@aubryJosephConradLife1927 268]. Like Woolf, Conrad is concerned with the accuracy of the image and its ability to faithfully represent the thought or emotion that generated it.

This essay-novel of Wells's, /A Modern Utopia/, describes a vision for a utopian world as an theatrical/cinematic image which is projected against a wall by a defective cinematograph, before which pass his two central characters, and the narrator, who resembles Wells himself:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  So much by way of portraiture is necessary to present the explorers of the Modern Utopia, which will unfold itself as a background to these two enquiring figures. The image of a cinematograph entertainment is the one to grasp. There will be an effect of these two people going to and fro in front of the circle of a rather defective lantern, which sometimes jams and sometimes gets out of focus, but which does occasionally succeed in displaying on a screen a momentary moving picture of Utopian conditions. Occasionally the picture goes out altogether, the Voice argues and argues, and the footlights return, and then you find yourself listening again to the rather too plump little man at his table laboriously enunciating propositions, upon whom the curtain rises now.
#+END_QUOTE

Wells highlights static aspects of a technology meant to depict motion ("cinematograph" is a compound of κίνημα, motion, and γράφειν, to depict), reminding us that illusion of motion that the device allows is, at its base, a sequence of still images.

# Bergson on the sequential image

** Coda
Textual images, as conceived by this period's many imagisms, have a number of discernible visual properties. They are often free of "decoration" or "ornament"---"dry." We might construe decoration as as a term or set of terms both extrinsic to the information conveyed by the syntactic frame, and possessing also some other redeeming value, whether as a pleasant sonic quality or other similar property. Images also convey visual information, such as color, shape, size, or space. This visual information is well-defined, that is, carries "hard" boundaries. Images represent, or convey, an "emotional complex"---they must be translatable into human emotion. Therefore, they would need to interact on some level with the human scale, and with human conceptions of objects. Images represent events or experiences: occurrences in time. They do not always take place in time, but are suggestive of the passage of time. A skein of silk blown against a wall, as in Pound's poem "The Garden," holds within it a kind of potential energy: the silk will fall, and so the image contains within it the suggestion of a future movement through time. As seen, as written, as read, as experienced, and as imagined, Images are distinct entities from one another, yet analogous. The media of each condition their potential properties. They are interdependent, and are in some cases translations of each another.

What can we do with this information? For one, this gives us a taxonomy of visual properties which we can use to test, quantitatively, trends in visual phenomena over the course of this period of time. For another, we now have a number of hypotheses related to these visual properties which we can verify. For example, is imagistic or impressionistic writing more dense with haiku-like nature imagery, or is that merely a side-effect of the world-literary interests of the imagists? Are the sizes of things represented in this writing that much smaller—less "cosmic"—than elsewhere? How much more often do the jewel-bright colors of Noguchi appear than other colors? It will be the task of the following chapters to answer these questions and more.

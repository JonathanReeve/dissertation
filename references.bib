The volume also contains a lengthy introduction to Bakhtin and his thought and a glossary of terminology.Bakhtin uses the category \&quot;novel\&quot; in a highly idiosyncratic way, claiming for it vastly larger territory than has been traditionally accepted. For him, the novel is not so much a genre as it is a force, \&quot;novelness,\&quot; which he discusses in \&quot;From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse.\&quot; Two essays, \&quot;Epic and Novel\&quot; and \&quot;Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel,\&quot; deal with literary history in Bakhtin\&\#39;s own unorthodox way.

According to Virginia Woolf, the goal of the essay 'is simply that it should give pleasure...It should lay us under a spell with its first word, and we should only wake, refreshed, with its last.' One of the best practitioners of the art she analysed so rewardingly, Woolf displayed her essay-writing skills across a wide range of subjects, with all the craftsmanship, substance, and rich allure of her novels. This selection brings together thirty of her best essays, including the famous 'Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown', a clarion call for modern fiction. She discusses the arts of writing and of reading, and the particular role and reputation of women writers. She writes movingly about her father and the art of biography, and of the London scene in the early decades of the twentieth century. Overall, these pieces are as indispensable to an understanding of this great writer as they are enchanting in their own right.},

For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.},

  shorttitle = {At the {{Violet Hour}}},
  abstract = {At the Violet Hour argues that the literature of the early twentieth-century in England and Ireland was deeply organized around a reckoning with grievous violence, imagined as intimate, direct, and often transformative. The book aims to excavate and amplify a consistent feature of this literature, which is that its central operations (formal as well as thematic) emerge specifically in reference to violence. At the Violet Hour offers a variety of new terms and paradigms for reading violence in literary works, most centrally the concepts it names "enchanted and disenchanted violence." In addition to defining key aspects of literary violence in the period, including the notion of "violet hour," the book explores three major historical episodes: dynamite violence and anarchism in the nineteenth century, which provided a vibrant, new consciousness about explosion, sensationalism, and the limits of political meaning in the act of violence; the turbulent events consuming Ireland in the first thirty years of the century, including the Rising, the War of Independence, and the Civil War, all of which play a vital role in defining the literary corpus; and the 1930s build-up to WWII, including the event that most enthralled Europe in these years, the Spanish Civil War. These historical upheavals provide the imaginative and physical material for a re-reading of four canonical writers (Eliot, Conrad, Yeats, and Woolf), understood not only as including violence in their works, but as generating their primary styles and plots out of its deformations. Included also in this panorama are a host of other works, literary and non-literary, including visual culture, journalism, popular novels, and other modernist texts.},

Ardis emphasizes the ways in which modernists secured their cultural centrality, she documents their support of mainstream attitudes toward science, their retreat from a supposed valuing of scandalous sexuality in the wake of Oscar Wilde's trials in 1895, and the conservative cultural and sexual politics masked by their radical formalist poetics. She recovers key instances of opposition to modernist self-fashioning in British socialism and feminism of the period.

  abstract = {A Geneology of Modernism is a study of literary transition in the first two decades of the twentieth-century, a period of extraordinary ferment and great accomplishment, during which the avant-garde gradually consolidated a secure place within English culture. Michael Levenson analyses that complex process by following the successive phases of a literary movement - Impressionist, Imagist, Vorticist, Classicist - as it attempted to formulate the principles on which a new aesthetic might be founded. The emphasis here falls on the ideology of modernism, but throughout the book the ideological question is tied on the one hand to specific literary works and on the other to general movements in philosophy and the fine arts. The major figures under discussion, Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, and T. S. Elliot, are placed in relation to thinkers who have been largely neglected in the history of modernism: Max Stirner, Wilhelm Worringer, Pierre Lasserre, Allen Upward, and Hilaire Belloc. Levenson thus situates the emergence of a modernist aesthetic within the context of literary theory, literary practice, and cultural history.},

Seeking a more subtle understanding of the relations between the period's texts and contexts, he provides not only an excellent survey but also a significant reassessment of Modernism itself.Spanning many decades, illuminating individual achievements and locating them within the intersecting histories of experiment (Symbolism to Surrealism, Naturalism to Expressionism, Futurism to Dadaism), the book places the transformations of culture alongside the agitations of modernity (war, revolution, feminism, psychoanalysis). In this perspective, Modernism must be understood more broadly than simply in terms of its provocative works, experimental forms, and singular careers. Rather, as Levenson demonstrates, Modernism should be viewed as the emergence of an adversary culture of the New that depended on audiences as well as artists, enemies as well as supporters.},

Subjects listened to words under two different instructional conditions: to generate visual mental images of the words' referents, or to simply listen to each word and wait for the next word. Analyses were performed which directly compared the regional brain activity during each condition, with the goal of discovering whether mental image generation engages modality-specific visual areas, whether it engages primary visual cortex, and whether it recruits the left hemisphere to a greater extent than the right. Results revealed that visual association cortex, and not primary visual cortex, was engaged during the mental image generation condition. Left inferior temporal lobe (Brodmann's area 37) was the most reliably and robustly activated area across subjects, but some subjects had activity which extended superiorly into occipital association cortex (area 19). The results of this experiment support the hypothesis that visual mental imagery is a function of visual association cortex, and that image generation is asymmetrically localized to the left.},

  abstract = {Visual imagery is a form of sensory imagination, involving subjective experiences typically described as similar to perception, but which occur in the absence of corresponding external stimuli. We used the Activation Likelihood Estimation algorithm (ALE) to identify regions consistently activated by visual imagery across 40 neuroimaging studies, the first such meta-analysis. We also employed a recently developed multi-modal parcellation of the human brain to attribute stereotactic co-ordinates to one of 180 anatomical regions, the first time this approach has been combined with the ALE algorithm. We identified a total 634 foci, based on measurements from 464 participants. Our overall comparison identified activation in the superior parietal lobule, particularly in the left hemisphere, consistent with the proposed ‘top-down’ role for this brain region in imagery. Inferior premotor areas and the inferior frontal sulcus were reliably activated, a finding consistent with the prominent semantic demands made by many visual imagery tasks. We observed bilateral activation in several areas associated with the integration of eye movements and visual information, including the supplementary and cingulate eye fields (SCEFs) and the frontal eye fields (FEFs), suggesting that enactive processes are important in visual imagery. V1 was typically activated during visual imagery, even when participants have their eyes closed, consistent with influential depictive theories of visual imagery. Temporal lobe activation was restricted to area PH and regions of the fusiform gyrus, adjacent to the fusiform face complex (FFC). These results provide a secure foundation for future work to characterise in greater detail the functional contributions of specific areas to visual imagery.},

Research based on subjective phenomenology indicates that otherwise healthy people can completely lack the experience of visual imagery, a condition now referred to as aphantasia. As congenital aphantasia has thus far been based on subjective reports, it remains unclear whether individuals are really unable to imagine visually, or if they have very poor metacognition – they have images in their mind, but are blind to them. Here we measured sensory imagery in subjectively self-diagnosed aphantasics, using the binocular rivalry paradigm, as well as measuring their self-rated object and spatial imagery with multiple questionnaires (VVIQ, SUIS and OSIQ). Unlike, the general population, experimentally naive aphantasics showed almost no imagery-based rivalry priming. Aphantasic participants' self-rated visual object imagery was significantly below average, however their spatial imagery scores were above average. These data suggest that aphantasia is a condition involving a lack of sensory and phenomenal imagery, and not a lack of metacognition. The possible underlying neurological cause of aphantasia is discussed as well as future research directions.},

Parametric analysis of brain activation in relation to imagery vividness across the entire group of participants revealed distinct patterns of positive and negative correlation. In particular, several posterior cortical regions show a positive correlation with imagery vividness: regions of the fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate and parahippocampal gyri (BAs 19, 29, 31 and 36) displayed exclusively positive correlations. By contrast several frontal regions including parts of anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24) and inferior frontal gyrus (BAs 44 and 47), as well as the insula (BA 13), auditory cortex (BA 41) and early visual cortices (BAs 17 and 18) displayed exclusively negative correlations. We discuss these results in relation to a previous, functional imaging study of a clinical case of ‘blind imagination’, and to the existing literature on the functional imaging correlates of imagery vividness and related phenomena in visual and other domains.},

  abstract = {Previous research suggests that the right hemisphere (RH) may contribute uniquely to the processing of metaphoric language. However, most studies have focused on familiar metaphoric expressions. The present study used the divided visual field paradigm to examine the role of the right cerebral hemisphere in processing novel metaphoric expressions taken from poetry. In two experiments, participants were presented with four types of word pairs, literal, conventional metaphoric and novel metaphoric expressions and unrelated word pairs, and asked to perform a semantic judgment task. Two different SOAs: 400 and 1100ms were used. The results of both experiments showed that responses to LVF/RH presented target words were more accurate and faster than responses to RVF/LH target words for novel metaphoric expressions, but not for other types of word pairs. These results support previous research indicating that during word recognition, the RH activates a broader range of related meanings than the LH, including novel, nonsalient meanings. The findings thus suggest that the RH may be critically involved in at least one important component of novel metaphor comprehension, i.e., the integration of the individual meanings of two seemingly unrelated concepts into a meaningful metaphoric expression.},

  abstract = {Novel metaphoric sentences have repeatedly evoked larger N400 amplitudes than literal sentences, while investigations of the late positive complex (LPC) have brought inconsistent results, with reports of both increased and reduced amplitudes. In two experiments, we examined novel metaphor comprehension in Polish, using the same set of literal, novel metaphoric, and anomalous sentences. The first aim of the study was to test whether novel metaphors would evoke larger or smaller late positivity complex (LPC) amplitudes compared to literal and anomalous sentences. Some earlier studies have shown that whether increased LPC amplitudes are observed or not may be related to the task participants are asked to perform, with explicit acceptability judgments being more likely to evoke the LPC effect. The second aim of the study was, thus, to test whether the observed LPC pattern would be the same across two tasks, the semantic decision task (Experiment 1) and the reading task (Experiment 2). Our results replicated the N400 effect observed in earlier studies on metaphor in both experiments. Most importantly, a reduction in late positivity to novel metaphors relative to anomalous sentences was found in both experiments. Additionally, this difference was broadly distributed over parietal sites in Experiment 1, and clearly left-lateralized in Experiment 2, which might imply differences in the involvement of recollection and semantic processes. Overall, these results seem to indicate that both conventionality and task demands modulate the LPC pattern.},

  abstract = {There is currently much interest in investigating the neural substrates of metaphor processing. In particular, it has been suggested that the right hemisphere plays a special role in the comprehension of figurative (non-literal) language, and in particular metaphors. However, some studies find no evidence of right hemisphere involvement in metaphor comprehension (e.g. [Lee, S. S., \& Dapretto, M. (2006). Metaphorical vs. literal word meanings: fMRI evidence against a selective role of the right hemisphere. NeuroImage, 29, 536–544; Rapp, A. M., Leube, D. T., Erb, M., Grodd, W., \& Kircher, T. T. J. (2004). Neural correlates of metaphor processing. Cognitive Brain Research, 20, 395–402]). We suggest that lateralization differences between literal and metaphorical language may be due to factors such as differences in familiarity ([Schmidt, G. L., DeBuse, C. J., \& Seger, C. A. (2007). Right hemisphere metaphor processing? Characterizing the lateralization of semantic processes. Brain and Language, 100, 127–141]), or difficulty ([Bookheimer, S. (2002). Functional MRI of language: New approaches to understanding the cortical organization of semantic processing. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 25, 151–188; Rapp, A. M., Leube, D. T., Erb, M., Grodd, W., \& Kircher, T. T. J. (2004). Neural correlates of metaphor processing. Cognitive Brain Research, 20, 395–402]) in addition to figurativeness. The purpose of this study was to separate the effects of figurativeness, familiarity, and difficulty on the recruitment of neural systems involved in language, in particular right hemisphere mechanisms. This was achieved by comparing neural activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) between four conditions: literal sentences, familiar and easy to understand metaphors, unfamiliar and easy to understand metaphors, and unfamiliar and difficult to understand metaphors. Metaphors recruited the right insula, left temporal pole and right inferior frontal gyrus in comparison with literal sentences. Familiar metaphors recruited the right middle frontal gyrus when contrasted with unfamiliar metaphors. Easy metaphors showed higher activation in the left middle frontal gyrus as compared to difficult metaphors, while difficult metaphors showed selective activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus as compared to easy metaphors. We conclude that the right hemisphere is involved in metaphor processing and that the factors of figurativeness, familiarity and difficulty are important in determining neural recruitment of semantic processing.},

However, it is not clear how the brain actually creates nonliteral language. Therefore, the present study for the first time investigates the neural correlates of metaphor production. Participants completed sentences by generating novel metaphors or literal synonyms during functional imaging. Responses were spoken aloud in the scanner, recorded, and subsequently rated for their creative quality. We found that metaphor production was associated with focal activity in predominantly left-hemispheric brain regions, specifically the left angular gyrus, the left middle and superior frontal gyri—corresponding to the left dorsomedial prefrontal (DMPFC) cortex—and the posterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, brain activation in the left anterior DMPFC and the right middle temporal gyrus was found to linearly increase with the creative quality of metaphor responses. These findings are related to neuroscientific evidence on metaphor comprehension, creative idea generation and episodic future thought, suggesting that creating metaphors involves the flexible adaptation of semantic memory to imagine and construct novel figures of speech. Furthermore, the left DMPFC may exert executive control to maintain strategic search and selection, thus facilitating creativity of thought.},

We teach by illustrations, models, and object-lessons, and reduce complex relations to the curves of the graphic method, to bring home and impress our statements. Our every-day language, as well as the imagery of poetry, abounds in metaphors and similes appealing to images which the eye has taught us to appreciate. The eye is also the medium of impressions of aesthetic as well as of intellectual value; and one grand division of art is lost to those who cannot see. This chapter discusses topics such as: the role of vision in mental life, the retention of vision in dreams as dependent upon the age of the loss of sight, corroborations of the above results by other evidence, and the dreams of the blind-deaf. The chapter also discusses Helen Keller's account of her dream-life. Finally this chapter closes with discussion of the distinctions in dream-life of incidents experienced during the period of sight from those of the blindness period, the imagination of the blind and the illustrations of their dreams.

  abstract = {In this essay I argue that sight-oriented linguistic cues within a text can encourage the reader to visualize, and I examine Imagist poetry for these inducements. My analysis begins with the premise that texts implicitly guide the reader's imagination and that certain words automatically urge a reader to image. In addition to these prompts, Imagist poetry is rife with moments of “directed seeing,” explicit references within the poem to the act of seeing; given the implicit textual guidance provided by the poem, the poem's speaker effectively instructs the reader with these sight references to mentally image what the speaker “sees.” Experimental research supports this notion of visual prompting: when subjects are instructed to form images, the otherwise low imagers of the group produce strong imagery effects. The poetic speaker's de facto instructions to “see” are powered by a similar, though less explicit, element of prompting that promotes visual imagery in readers.},

  abstract = {[The poems of Fêtes galantes by Paul Verlaine have marked visual and musical aspects with which criticism often deals by comparing the subject matter and style of the poems with those of paintings by Watteau and music by Debussy. It is more rewarding to study similarities of basic artistic form in these works about the Rococo dream world; in particular, the visual and spatial imagery shared by Verlaine and Watteau helps elucidate Fêtes galantes. The vague, ambiguous, and shifting impressions sought by Verlaine are created visually by Watteau as the latter varies sharp delineation with hazy blending. The paintings tend to have either detached foreground figures or a merging of figures into a misty background. Verlaine uses these effects of detachment and merging in virtual space, verbally rendered, and coordinates them with the recurrent themes of his suite of poems. A visualized pattern along a time line results as he shifts from one effect to the other in individual works and in the total composition. Much of the musicality of the work is thus produced through visual and spatial imagery in sequence. Increased understanding of Verlaine's creation of artistic form suggests the need for study of the relationships between this form and the contents of the poems.]},

  abstract = {[In all visual forms which carry meaning, from architecture to painting, the author points out that there is a level of organization which is rhetorical. The whole meaning of a work of art is the sphere of iconology. The study of its forms without regard to symbolic or other meaning is formal analysis. The area between, where the lesser forms of organization of meaning occur, is the area of visual rhetoric. Rhetoric is used in its classical, verbal sense as the means by which words are chosen, pitched to some diction, pointed with gestures and expression, and arrayed in order to affect a listener towards some end. Visual rhetoric overlaps verbal rhetoric when the material it orders translates easily from words to images and back, as in Renaissance and Baroque painting done under the motto 'ut pictura poesis'. By far the largest part of visual rhetoric has no verbal analogues and is, in fact, the discovery of the non-literary art of our time. The author states that the concept of the rhetoric of vision puts into a coherent system our ideas of style, genres, modes of representation, iconography, media, personal manner, format, composition and the negation of all or any of these. Visual rhetoric is the Iconography of the twentieth century. /// L'auteur montre que, dans toutes les formes plastiques porteuses de signification, de l'architecture à la peinture, il existe un niveau d'organisation rhétorique de cette signification. La signification globale d'une œuvre d'art est du domaine de l'iconologie; alors que de procéder à une étude des formes qu'elle présente sans la relier à une signification symbolique ou autre revient à faire une analyse formelle. C'est entre ces deux points de vue, là où se manifestent les formes inférieures d'organisation de la signification, que se place le domaine de la rhétorique visuelle. 'Rhétorique' est ici employé dans son sens les plus classique et verbal, comme le moyen de choisir des mots, de les adapter à un style, de les mettre en relief grâce à des gestes ou à des expressions, et de les arranger de façon à produire un certain effet sur l'auditeur. La rhétorique visuelle dépasse la rhétorique verbale lorsque ce qu'elle ordonnance passe facilement des mots aux images et vice versa, comme c'est le cas de la peinture de la Renaissance et de l'époque Baroque qui suivirent la devise 'ut pictura poesis'. En grande partie, il n'est rien de comparable à la rhétorique visuelle, laquelle consiste, de fait, en la découverte de l'art non-littéraire de notre époque. L'auteur pense que le concept de la rhétorique de la vision permet de rassembler dans un système cohérent nos idées de style, genres, modes de représentation, iconographie, moyens, manière personnelle, format, composition, ainsi que la négation de tout ou partie de ces éléments. La rhétorique visuelle est l'iconographie du vingtième siècle.]},

  abstract = {[Bashō's haiku and the poetry of the imagists are the two most prominent examples of extremely short poetic forms in world literature. Their brevity matters, for the drastic reduction in space bespeaks the poets' fundamental questioning of what poetry really is: there is no room to be anything but "poetic." For the imagists, this meant fresh imagery as a means of cognitive exploration. Preoccupied with "newness," however, they tended to disregard the importance of the "old" as a necessary means to set off novelty, an oversight that led to their eventual demise. Haiku, on the other hand, is a genre of long standing, firmly rooted in tradition. The key to its unabated vigor lies in Bashō's keen awareness of the utility of the past in undertaking an avant-garde enterprise, which he summed up in his famous adage "fueki-ryūkō," which can be roughly translated as "permanence and change." My essay undertakes a detailed and comparative stylistic and semiotic analysis of a few representative works by Basho and the Imagists, exploring the part tradition plays in them.]},

  abstract = {[This article considers the evolution of Hulme's thought from his 'Lecture on Modern Poetry' to 'Romanticism and Classicism', including the development of his belief in poetry as a visual language, why he defines the 'aesthetic emotion' in such a limited way, and why he links these ideas to the Classicism of Action Française. What it demonstrates is that William James's description of the distinction between Romantic and Classical art in Principles of Psychology played a part in helping Hulme to reduce Bergson's concept of 'aesthetic emotion' to sensation, and to see such effects as pertaining to Classical, rather than Romantic art. However, Hulme failed to realise that Bergson's ideas on art were in fact incompatible with William James's. This incompatibility caused tensions between the theory and practice of the Imagist movement inspired by Hulme's ideas. The conflict was caused partly by James's denial of the uniqueness of aesthetic emotion, and partly because, in reducing the aesthetic emotion to sensation, he negates the importance of memory and association to the image's aesthetic effect, which is by its very nature temporal in manifestation. The piece concludes by demonstrating how the poem 'Hermes of the Ways', by H.D., does not concord with Pound's doctrine of image as an 'intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time', and needs memory and association to unravel if the image is to work. This critique demonstrates the divergence between genuine Imagist practice and William James's prioritisation of immediate sensation, which Hulme had communicated to Imagist theory.]},

With reference to vividness, 3 grades or intensities of visual imagery have been discriminated: Pictures of things or typographical images, distinct images filled with substance, and richer images. They may also be divided into voluntary or memory images, and spontaneous and irrelevant images. Projections are images that intrude upon the conscious of real space, such that sensible ideas become sensation without any material alteration of character and content. Images seem larger when projected on a distant screen, and smaller when projected on a nearer one. In dreams, objects appear to be the size of real objects, and do not appear as images, but as real things. A number of factors like attention, interest, and suggestion influence imagery. It has been also discussed in terms of dissociation and ideal synthesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {In this lively, personal book, Robert Scholes intervenes in ongoing discussions about modernism in the arts during the crucial half-century from 1895 to 1945. While critics of and apologists for modernism have defined modern art and literature in terms of binary oppositions—high/low, old/new, hard/soft, poetry/rhetoric—Scholes contends that these distinctions are in fact confused and misleading. Such oppositions are instances of “paradoxy”—an apparent clarity that covers real confusion.Closely examining specific literary texts, drawings, critical writings, and memoirs, Scholes seeks to complicate the neat polar oppositions attributed to modernism. He argues for the rehabilitation of works in the middle ground that have been trivialized in previous evaluations, and he fights orthodoxy with such paradoxes as “durable fluff,” “formulaic creativity,” and “iridescent mediocrity.” The book reconsiders major figures like James Joyce while underscoring the value of minor figures and addressing new attention to others rarely studied. It includes twenty-two illustrations of the artworks discussed. Filled with the observations of a personable and witty guide, this is a book that opens up for a reader’s delight the rich cultural terrain of modernism.},

Ekphrasis has been traditionally regarded as a form of paragone (competition) between word and image. This interdisciplinary collection of essays seeks to complicate this critical paradigm and proposes a more reciprocal model of ekphrasis that involves an encounter or exchange between visual and textual cultures. This critical and theoretical shift demands a new form of ekphrastic poetics, which is less concerned with representational and institutional struggles, and more concerned with ideas of ethics, affect and intersubjectivity. Ekphrastic encounters brings together leading scholars working in the field of word-and-image studies and offers a fresh exploration of ekphrastic texts from the Renaissance to the present day. Taken together, the chapters establish a new set of theoretical frameworks for exploring the ekphrastic encounter. -- Klappentext Introduction: from paragone to encounter - David Kennedy and Richard MeekPart I: Early modern encounters 1 'Lamentable objects': ekphrasis and historical materiality in Shakespeare's The Rape of Lucrece - Rachel Eisendrath2 'Fabulously counterfeit': ekphrastic encounters in Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy - Richard Meek3 'Art indeed is long, but life is short': ekphrasis and mortality in Andrew Marvell - Keith McDonald 4 'The Painter has made a finer Story than the Poet': Jonathan Richardson's ekphrastic 'Dissertation' on Poussin's Tancred and Erminia - Jason LawrencePart II: Nineteenth-century encounters 5 Blind spots of narration?

In that respect, fragmentation, disunity, relativity of things, break with tradition, as well as the depiction of life’s disorder, are disputed and seen as aesthetic means for the promotion of certain ideologies.Aesthetics and Ideology of D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, and T. S. Eliot offers a smooth transition from general discussion and revision of some fixed concepts related to Modernism, through individual authors and their major works to the conclusion where the main findings are summarized and further explicated.Apart from dealing with Modernism in general, Aesthetics and Ideology of D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf and T. S. Eliot presents a somewhat different view on the authors it deals with. They are not only seen as opponents of established religious, political, and social views, but to a certain extent as their perpetrators. This duality concerning their stances is reconciled by their insisting on the aesthetic unity.},

  abstract = {The spontaneous use of imagery and its relationship to free verbal recall were investigated. Community college students read a 2,100-word story under one of three sets of instructions and then recalled the story and reported their images immediately and 48 hours later. A new methodology for classifying imagery reports was developed. Results indicated that separate categories of imagery reports and verbal recalls were not highly correlated. Principal components analysis yielded factors predominated by imagery variables. Further, whereas total verbal recall declined over the retention interval (i.e., forgetting), imagery did not. Experimental instructions to readers designed to manipulate processing depth in an externally valid fashion did not result in significant differences in imagery reporting and recall, suggesting that a strict levels of processing view may be untenable for ecologically valid reading situations. Other results indicated that a significant relationship existed between imaging a story segment and the story grammar macro-structure of that segment, and that imagery of the climactic event was the most common. This study contributes to a series of studies using various texts and methodologies that suggest that imagery is a distinctive aspect of reading, viable for study in its own right.},

  abstract = {The objective of this article is twofold. In the first part, I discuss two issues central to any theoretical inquiry into mental imagery: embodiment and consciousness. I do so against the backdrop of second-generation cognitive science, more specifically the increasingly popular research framework of embodied cognition, and I consider two caveats attached to its current exploitation in narrative theory. In the second part, I attempt to cast new light on readerly mental imagery by offering a typology of what I propose to be its four basic varieties. The typology is grounded in the framework of embodied cognition and it is largely compatible with key neuroscientific and other experimental evidence produced within the framework. For each imagery variety, I make some elementary suggestions as to how it may typically be cued by distinct narrative strategies.},

As René Wellek suggests in his historiographic contribution, the fifty-one contributors not only make us think afresh about individual authors who are giants, but also draw us to reassess schools and movements in their local as well as international contexts. Reviewers comment that this copious and intelligently structured anthology, divided into eight parts, traces the conceptual bases and emergence of an international Symbolist movement, showing the spread of Symbolism to other national literatures from French sources, as well as the symbiotic transformations of Symbolism through appropriation and amalgamation with local literary trends. Several chapters deal with the relationships between literature and the other arts, pointing to Symbolism at work in painting, music, and theatre. Other chapters on the psychological aspects of the Symbolist method connect in interesting ways to a vision of metaphor and myth as virtually musical notation and an experimental emphasis on the play afforded by gaps between words. The volume is a major contribution to the most significant exponents and essential themes of Symbolism. The theoretical, historical, and typological sections of the volume help explain why the impact of this important movement of the fin-de-siècle is still felt today.},

The sixty-six pieces in Pound's "Selected Prose 1909-1965" are arranged thematically, and while they are organized chronologically within several groupings, there are natural cross-currents of thoughts among them. Particular emphasis, however, is given to the article concerned with "Civilization, Money and History." This section contains such essential texts as the "ABC of Economics" and "What is Money For?" as well as two essays - "Gold and Work" and "A Visiting Car" - translated from Pound's Italian and never before published in English in their entirety. Much space is devoted, too, to Pound's evaluation of his native America, its history, culture, economy, and his 1913 essay, "Patria Mia, " is reprinted.},

  abstract =     {Literary studies are at a tipping point. ." There is broad
                  agreement that the discipline is in "crisis" - that it is
                  aimless, that its intellectual energy is spent, that all of
                  the trends are bad, and that fundamental change will be
                  required to set things right. But there is little agreement on
                  what those changes should be, and no one can predict which way
                  things will ultimately tip. Literature, Science, and a New
                  Humanities represents a bold new response to the crisis in
                  academic literary studies. This book presents a total
                  challenge to dominant paradigms of literary analysis and
                  offers a sweeping critique of those paradigms, and sketches
                  outlines of a new paradigm inspired by scientific theories,
                  methods, and attitudes.},

                  since its origins in the 1980s. It has been applied, compared

                  in discourse analysis, theoretical linguistics,
                  psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics. In this

                  analyses and psychological validity, together with a
                  discussion of the nature of text relations. We also propose

                  volume addresses diverse issues such as aesthetics, the
                  functions of the press, censorship, Irish cultural history,
                  English literature and Empire. The collection includes
                  newspaper articles, reviews, lectures and essays, and covers
                  40 years of Joyce's life. These pieces also clarify and
                  illuminate the transformations in Joyce's fiction, from
                  Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man to the
                  first drafts of Ulysses. Gathering together more than fifty
                  essays, several of which have never been available in an
                  English edition, this is the most complete and the most
                  helpfully annotated collection. About the Series: For over 100
                  years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest
                  spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable
                  volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing
                  the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable
                  features, including expert introductions by leading
                  authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date

                  books which are absolutely necessary for anyone who wants to
                  know Joyce thoroughly."–Robert Adams Day, Queens College, City
                  University of New York Latin was James Joyce's first second
                  language and arguably the most significant linguistic stratum
                  in his work. This long-awaited book provides a comprehensive
                  review of the role of Latin in Joyce's life and the pervasive
                  contribution of Roman literature and culture to each of his
                  works. Topics include a demonstration of Joyce's fascination
                  with the intricacies of Latin grammar and syntax; a review of
                  the impact of Vergil, Cicero, Horace, and Ovid on his writing;
                  and a survey of allusions to Roman history from Aeneas to the
                  collapse of the Empire. Throughout, R. J. Schork makes
                  extensive use of Joyce's original composition in Latin, his
                  notebooks, and the Trieste and Paris libraries. A work that
                  Joyceans will read from cover to cover and then repeatedly
                  consult for explications of specific passages, this book
                  should also prove of interest to classical scholars curious to
                  see the master of modern literature abuse the subjunctive mood
                  or the ablative plural, play with the subjective and objective
                  genitive, rattle off rhymed parodies of classroom declensions,
                  and distort Horatian tag-lines–all to great comedic and
                  literary effect. R. J. Schork is professor emeritus of
                  classics at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and
                  author of Sacred Song from the Byzantine Pulpit: Romanos the

  shorttitle =   {Defining {{Shakespeare}}},
  abstract =     {That very great play, Pericles', as T. S. Eliot called it,
                  poses formidable problems of text and authorship. The first of
                  the Late Romances, it was ascribed to Shakespeare when printed
                  in a quarto of 1609, but was not included in the First Folio
                  (1623) collection of his plays. This book examines rival
                  theories about the quarto's origins and offers compelling
                  evidence that Pericles is the product of collaboration between
                  Shakespeare and the minor dramatist George Wilkins, who was
                  responsible for the first two acts and for portions of the
                  'brothel scenes' in Act 4. Pericles serves as a test case for
                  methodologies that seek to define the limits of the
                  Shakespeare canon and to rdentify co-authors. A wide range of
                  metrical, lexical, and other data is analysed. Computerized
                  'stylometric' texts are explained and their findings assessed.
                  A concluding chapter introduces a new technique that has the
                  potential to answer many of the remaining questions of
                  attribution associated with Shakespeare and his
                  contemporaries.},

                  Tea Party}}, {{Obama}} and {{Legislators}}' {{Changing
                  Expressed Priorities}}},
  abstract =     {Legislators use public communication to define the type of
                  representation they provide constituents. This chapter
                  characterizes how legislators define the type of
                  representation they provide to constituents and shows how this
                  definition of representation changes in response to shifts in
                  electoral pressure and changes in party control of Congress.
                  To demonstrate this change, I use a large collection of every
                  House press release from 2005 to 2010 and a statistical topic
                  model that measures legislators' expressed priorities|their
                  attention to salient topics. To increase substantive inter-
                  pretability and address questions about the number of topics
                  to include in the model, the model estimates a hierarchy of
                  topics. A set of granular issue specific topics are nested in
                  a set of coarse topics that capture broad differences in the
                  content of press releases. Using estimates of legislators'
                  attention to both types of topics, I show that, like senators,
                  House members' expressed priorities lie on a credit
                  claiming/position taking spectrum. And where House members
                  fall on this spectrum depends not only on who they represent,
                  but also responds to broad political changes. After the 2008
                  election, representatives' shift their expressed
                  priorities|Republicans abandon credit claiming and articulate
                  criticism towards Obama, while Democrats embrace credit
                  claiming and defend the federal stimulus. Yet, even after
                  responding to the changing conditions, legislators largely
                  maintain the same broad style. The results in this chapter
                  demonstrate the strategic ways legislators change how they
                  communicate with constituents and demonstrates the utility of
                  computational tools for studying representation.},

  abstract =     {Katherine Mansfield's "The Garden Party" exposes the economic
                  disparities within the white colonial community of New Zealand
                  in the early twentieth century. While the wealthy Sheridan
                  family enjoys a garden that produces "literally hundreds" of
                  roses on "green bushes bowed down as though they had been
                  visited by archangels," the gardens within the working class
                  neighborhood adjacent to the Sheridan house contain "nothing
                  but cabbage stalks, sick hens and tomato cans. Laura Sheridan,
                  the protagonist of "The Garden Party," crosses the "the broad
                  road" separating the classes in order to deliver a basket of
                  party leftovers to the family of a deceased workman, a carter
                  named Scott. In "The Garden Party," aestheticism plays a role
                  not only in the way Mansfield describes the mood and setting
                  or in the way Mansfield uses flowers symbolically, but
                  aestheticism becomes part of a conflict within the protagonist
                  herself. The story concerns the intersection of class politics
                  and aestheticism.},

  abstract =     {In spite of the general tribute to the artistic achievement of
                  “The Garden Party,” the question of its structural unity has
                  been one of the recurring themes in Mansfield criticism. The
                  present article approaches this question by means of an
                  analysis of two important elements of the story's narrative
                  composition: time and space. The analysis suggests that the
                  story's unity is of a dialectic nature. On a temporal level,
                  it falls into two major phases, the time before and after the
                  party, while the party itself is virtually insignificant.
                  Whereas the first phase, which relates the preparations for
                  the party, shows a hectically accelerated time-pace,
                  resembling the time-lapse camera in film; the second phase,
                  which relates Laura's encounter with death, shows a
                  deceleration of the narrative pace, resembling the slow-motion
                  camera. With these two phases, two different kinds of
                  movements in space are correlated. The activities in the
                  Sheridans' house convey an impression of chaotic
                  disconnectedness, of a confusing simultaneity of different
                  aims and directions, while the story gains a clear aim and
                  direction in space in the second phase with Laura's visit to
                  the dead workman's house, linking the two opposing worlds in
                  her ‘transcendent’ experience.},

                  scholars and researchers to encode texts of any kind for
                  (almost) all kinds of purposes, but this excellent standard is
                  matched by an astounding diversity of publishing tools, which
                  is particularly true when it comes to image-based digital
                  editions. The different needs of scholars, coupled with the
                  constant search for an effective price/result ratio and the
                  local availability of technical skills, have led to a
                  remarkable fragmentation: publishing solutions range from
                  simple HTML pages produced using the TEI stylesheets (or the
                  TEI Boilerplate software) to very complex frameworks based on
                  CMS and SQL search engines. Researchers of the Digital
                  Vercelli Book project started looking into a simple,
                  user-friendly solution and eventually decided to build their
                  own: EVT (Edition Visualization Technology) has been under
                  development since about 2010 and has turned into a flexible

  isbn =         {978-0-8057-7056-8},
  abstract =     {In this new edition of Katherine Mansfield, Saralyn Daly
                  offers a timely and discerning assessment of one of the
                  century's most gifted writers of the short story. Out of
                  fashion with critics when the first edition was published in
                  1965, Mansfield has since come to be viewed as a major
                  influence on modernist and contemporary fiction. This revived
                  interest shows itself in various forms; a crop of critical
                  studies, mostly from scholars in her native New Zealand;
                  feminist interpretations of her work; and scholarly editions
                  of her poetry, critical writing, and letters, augmented by a
                  collection of letters between the author and her husband,
                  editor and critic John Middleton Murry. All of these new
                  sources, as well as Daly's close study of early drafts of
                  Mansfield's major stories, inform this book. Mansfield, who
                  died from tuberculosis in 1923 at age 34, wrote often of the
                  inadequacies of personal relationships. She sometimes used her
                  stories to express her feelings to her husband, but his
                  letters exhibit his failure to decode her messages; Mansfield
                  eventually stopped writing her stories "to" or about Murry.
                  This decision, recorded in one of her notebooks, freed her to
                  create her finest work during the last years of her life,
                  beginning with the stories "At the Bay," "The Garden Party,"
                  and "The Doll's House" and culminating in "The Daughters of
                  the Late Colonel" and "The Fly." Mansfield introduced most of
                  her character types - abused children, innocent young women
                  and isolated older women, exploited wives, and overbearing
                  husbands - in her earliest short story collection, In a German
                  Pensione. From the very first she wrote from what she knew;
                  her New Zealand youth, the artistic bohemian world of London,
                  the Continental world in which she convalesced. This choice of
                  subject matter has led biographers to assume her fiction is a
                  direct account of what they perceive to be an unhappy life -
                  an impression that is false, Daly writes, and that was
                  initiated largely by Murry, also Mansfield's literary
                  executor. Mansfield used her memories to compose fiction, but
                  her stories are not literal transcriptions of her experience.
                  In theme, style, and form Mansfield persistently developed her
                  craft. Daly describes the long, painstaking progress that
                  would establish her leadership in short story structure. While
                  Mansfield's stories reflect the spiritual and artistic malaise
                  of her age, they also represent acts of protest and social
                  criticism. Daly's study gives the reader access to a body of
                  work that for this very dissonance remains a cornerstone of
                  the modernist tradition in fiction.},

                  linguistiques contenues dans “The Garden Party” de Katherine
                  Mansfield constituent des marqueurs de l'identité de classe.
                  Tant le narrateur que les personnages de la classe supérieure
                  utilisent des modèles de discours reposant sur le démenti et
                  la négativité. À travers l'usage répété de questions polies,
                  les personnages établissent une hiérarchie d'attentes limitant
                  le choix et empêchant le défi. L'affirmation et l'assertion
                  sont rares; le démenti et la répression sont la règle.
                  Inversement, les membres des classes inférieures embrassent
                  l'affirmation et agissent. Ces résultats suggèrent que le
                  silence de Laura à la conclusion du texte doit être lu comme
                  un acte de résistance, un refus de continuer à suivre ces
                  formalités qui ont modelé sa vie et sa conscience jusqu'à ce

                  répandue que “The Garden Party” ne forme pas une position

  abstract =     {A study of how we should read one of America's most important
                  poets. Ben Hickman argues that we must attend to Ashbery's
                  radical conception of reading if we are to understand the
                  originality of his writing. His study focuses on Ashbery's
                  reading of English poets, including Andrew Marvell, John
                  Donne, William Wordsworth, John Clare, T. S. Eliot and W. H.
                  Auden, and examines Ashbery's writing in terms of an
                  'aesthetic of inattention'. Hickman critiques the
                  Americanisation of Ashbery's work as well as common
                  assumptions about his Romanticism, his avant-garde Modernism
                  and his engagement with the historical present. He
                  demonstrates that Ashbery's generosity as a writer is closely
                  tied to his generosity, inattention and situatedness as a
                  reader.},

                  listening to a brilliant talker who not only keeps us
                  entertained and laughing, but who also has wise things to say

                  last! Many of the fugitive pieces collected in this
                  volume---on Gertude Stein, on Frank O'Hara, on Marianne Moore
                  or Adrienne Rich---published as many of them were in
                  out-of-the way places, have already become collectors' items,
                  providing fascinating---and often startling--- assessments of
                  their subjects as well as new insight into Ashbery himself.
                  Now here they are between two covers, along with many hitherto
                  unknown pieces on subjects ranging from Michel Butor to Mary
                  Butts, Jane Freilicher to Mark Ford. For anyone who cares
                  about the contemporary poetry/art scene, this is an
                  indispensable collection." ---Marjorie Perloff, Stanford
                  University Selected Prose contains a broad selection of texts
                  by internationally acclaimed poet and critic John Ashbery.
                  This third collection of Ashbery's critical writings
                  dramatically expands the terrain covered by the first two,
                  Reported Sightings: Art Chronicles 1957-1987 and Other
                  Traditions (first presented as the Norton Lectures at
                  Harvard). These essays on writers, artists, filmmakers and the
                  life of a poet provide insight into Ashbery's evolution as one
                  of the major poets in English. Ashbery's criticism is as
                  essential to the cultural history of the twentieth century as
                  was that of T.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden. His unique sensibility
                  has had a profound impact on the literature and arts of our
                  time, and his influence is certain to be felt for decades to
                  come. Editor Eugene Richie's introduction provides a
                  meaningful context for fifty years' worth of critical and
                  creative prose by one of America's finest poets.},

  shorttitle =   {Empty {{Houses}}},
  abstract =     {According to the dominant tradition of literary criticism, the
                  novel is the form par excellence of the private individual.
                  Empty Houses challenges this consensus by reexamining the
                  genre's development from the mid-nineteenth to the
                  mid-twentieth century and exploring what has until now seemed
                  an anomaly--the frustrated theatrical ambitions of major
                  novelists. Offering new interpretations of the careers of
                  William Makepeace Thackeray, George Eliot, Henry James, James
                  Joyce, and James Baldwin--writers known for mapping
                  ever-narrower interior geographies--this book argues that the
                  genre's inward-looking tendency has been misunderstood.
                  Delving into the critical role of the theater in the origins
                  of the novel of interiority, David Kurnick reinterprets the
                  novel as a record of dissatisfaction with inwardness and an
                  injunction to rethink human identity in radically collective
                  and social terms. Exploring neglected texts in order to reread
                  canonical ones, Kurnick shows that the theatrical ambitions of
                  major novelists had crucial formal and ideological effects on
                  their masterworks. Investigating a key stretch of each of
                  these novelistic careers, he establishes the theatrical
                  genealogy of some of the signal techniques of narrative
                  interiority. In the process he illustrates how the novel is
                  marked by a hunger for palpable collectivity, and argues that
                  the genre's discontents have been a shaping force in its
                  evolution. A groundbreaking rereading of the novel, Empty
                  Houses provides new ways to consider the novelistic
                  imagination.},

                  unexpected and previously undocumented ways. The study is
                  based on a group of matching corpora, known as the 'Brown
                  family' of corpora, supplemented by a range of other corpus
                  materials, both written and spoken, drawn mainly from the
                  later twentieth century. Among the matters receiving
                  particular attention are the influence of American English on
                  British English, the role of the press, the
                  'colloquialization' of written English, and a wide range of

                  progressive, subjunctive, passive, genitive and relative
                  clauses. These subjects build an overall picture of how

                  that market. A recent import from Turkey, even the tulip's
                  name identified it as a stranger: the word derives from—and in
                  early modern orthography is sometimes identical with—the word
                  "turban," entering European languages as a deformation of the
                  Persian root dulband. In herbals, manuals of garden design,
                  poems, and other texts, the cultivation of Turkish tulips in
                  England comes to embody the problem of the cultural effects of
                  an expanding market—its way of violating national, racial, and
                  religious boundaries; even its denaturalization of the claims
                  of the "native" and the "foreign" in the figure of the migrant
                  flower that accommodates itself to a new soil and a new

  abstract =     {This essay explores Venice's recurrence as an implicit
                  structure in Ezra Pound's "Cantos," arguing that the built
                  archipelago provides a model for the modernist text, created
                  through engagement with recalcitrant objective dynamics
                  opposed to their containment by an imperious subject-and
                  proffering the canalized republic as a counter to Pound's
                  eventual fascist city of man. The rigorous empiricism of
                  Ruskin's Venetian histories supplies a founding set of tropes
                  through which the fluid, fractured cityscape becomes a taunt
                  to find material ground for historical meaning. Pound, taking
                  up the multiple construction of Venice that haunted Ruskin,
                  locates in it a utopian-and site-oriented-poetic structure
                  valorizing the interstitial and thus the relational, the
                  differential. The Venetian complex that emerges intermittently
                  in "The Cantos" literalizes the unsettling of Pound's attempt
                  to monumentalize the body politic, remaining unassimilated-and
                  challenging to efforts to transfix any totality construed as
                  part of the project of modernity.},

  title =        {Pound's {{Cantos Declassified}}},
  isbn =         {978-0-271-07182-4},
  abstract =     {By using his Cantos for storing, "making new," and
                  transmitting historical documents, Pound was returning the
                  epic to its ancient function as a tribal archive for the
                  "luminous details" of history that define a culture's past and
                  shape its future. So argues this book, which does not overlook
                  the poem's brilliant lyrical passages but for the first time
                  focuses on those vast stretches of Pound's epic composed not
                  of literary touchstones but of that most unpoetic of literary
                  forms, historical documents.Pound's task as epic poet was
                  complicated by the fact that the documents he wished to renew
                  and transmit to his culture were largely unknown, often
                  because in his mind they had been suppressed by a widespread
                  conspiracy throughout the ages which he termed the "historical
                  black-out." His Cantos therefore, he believed, must be a
                  counter-conspiracy to rescue vital documents from that
                  black-out, renew them, and then recirculate them to combat the
                  economic and political forces behind the black-out.Drawing on
                  recent research by numerous scholars, Furia traces the arcane
                  documents Pound unearthed from libraries around the world and
                  shows how he transmuted this documentary mass into poetry,
                  first by framing passages of prose to highlight their poetic
                  texture and then by weaving these shards and fragments into a
                  collage of intricate structure. Among the documents Furia
                  "declassifies" are Chinese edicts, Italian bank charters,
                  British factory commission reports, Byzantine guild
                  regulations, American Presidential papers, municipal records,
                  judicial writs, parliamentary statutes, legislative codes,
                  contracts, deeds, mandates, treaties, diary entries, and

  abstract =     {Measure for Measure is among the most passionately discussed
                  of Shakespeare’s plays. In it, a duke temporarily removes
                  himself from governing his city-state, deputizing a member of
                  his administration, Angelo, to enforce the laws more
                  rigorously. Angelo chooses as his first victim Claudio,
                  condemning him to death because he impregnated Juliet before
                  their marriage. Claudio’s sister Isabella, who is entering a
                  convent, pleads for her brother’s life. Angelo attempts to
                  extort sex from her, but Isabella preserves her chastity. The
                  duke, in disguise, eavesdrops as she tells her brother about
                  Angelo’s behavior, then offers to ally himself with her
                  against Angelo. Modern responses to the play show how it can
                  be transformed by its reception in present culture to evoke
                  continuing fascination. To some, the duke (the government)
                  seems meddlesome; to others, he is properly imposing moral
                  standards. Angelo and Isabella’s encounter exemplifies sexual
                  harassment. Others see a woman’s right to control her body in
                  Isabella’s choice between her virginity and her brother’s
                  life. The authoritative edition of Measure for Measure from
                  The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used
                  Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:

                  music. The catastrophe of the First World War, the emergence

  shorttitle =   {Reconciling {{Science}} and {{Religion}}},
  abstract =     {Although much has been written about the vigorous debates over
                  science and religion in the Victorian era, little attention
                  has been paid to their continuing importance in early
                  twentieth-century Britain. Reconciling Science and Religion
                  provides a comprehensive survey of the interplay between
                  British science and religion from the late nineteenth century
                  to World War II. Peter J. Bowler argues that unlike the United
                  States, where a strong fundamentalist opposition to
                  evolutionism developed in the 1920s (most famously expressed
                  in the Scopes "monkey trial" of 1925), in Britain there was a
                  concerted effort to reconcile science and religion.
                  Intellectually conservative scientists championed the
                  reconciliation and were supported by liberal theologians in
                  the Free Churches and the Church of England, especially the
                  Anglican "Modernists." Popular writers such as Julian Huxley
                  and George Bernard Shaw sought to create a non-Christian
                  religion similar in some respects to the Modernist position.
                  Younger scientists and secularists—including Rationalists such
                  as H. G. Wells and the Marxists—tended to oppose these
                  efforts, as did conservative Christians, who saw the liberal
                  position as a betrayal of the true spirit of their religion.
                  With the increased social tensions of the 1930s, as the
                  churches moved toward a neo-orthodoxy unfriendly to natural
                  theology and biologists adopted the "Modern Synthesis" of
                  genetics and evolutionary theory, the proposed reconciliation
                  fell apart. Because the tensions between science and
                  religion—and efforts at reconciling the two—are still very
                  much with us today, Bowler's book will be important for
                  everyone interested in these issues.},

  abstract =     {In The Birth of Modernism Leon Surette offers a radical
                  revision of our understanding of high modernism. Acknowledging
                  that current post-modern and theoretical critiques have
                  provoked fresh examination of the high culture of the first
                  half of this century, Surette rejects their characterization
                  of modernism as positivistic and absolutist, despite the
                  statements in the 1920s of modernists such as Pound, Eliot,
                  and Joyce. He also rejects the diametrically opposed New
                  Critical view of modernism as sceptical and
                  relativistic.Through an explanation of both familiar and
                  little-known theoretical writings of the late nineteenth and
                  early twentieth century - the work of Friedrich Nietzsche
                  receives particular attention - Surette develops a portrait of
                  modernism that demonstrates its continuity with American
                  transcendentalism, French symbolisme, and English
                  aestheticism. His account is, in many ways, a revival of an
                  early view of modernism as the heir of symbolisme, but Surette
                  documents, for the first time, the origins of modernist
                  aesthetics in the occult. Yeats' occultism has long been
                  acknowledged, but this is the first study to show that Pound's
                  early intimacy with Yeats was based largely on a shared
                  interest in the occult sciences, and that Pound's epic of the
                  modern age, The Cantos, is a deeply occult work.To
                  substantiate these claims Surette formulates a theory of the
                  occult and analyses the occult speculations of several of
                  Pound's close associates during his London years, relating
                  these to the work of influential Continental occultists and
                  Wagnerians. The author also examines the place of myth and
                  mythopoeia in modernist literature. He scrutinizes the complex
                  provenance of the theories of myth, to which modernists and
                  their apologists appeal, and demonstrates that positive
                  anthropology, Nietzschean philology, Wagnerian opera,
                  symbolisme, and occultism all contribute to the theories
                  expressed by Pound and, to some extent, to Eliot's poetry.In
                  light of these discoveries Surette considers Pound's editing
                  of Eliot's The Waste Land and concludes that the work's early
                  reception as an expression of scepticism and relativism has
                  obscured aspects of the poem that are consistent with Eliot's
                  earlier and later piety. Pound's ruthless cutting of the
                  manuscript, Surette asserts, was not motivated primarily by
                  stylistic concerns, as has generally been contended in the
                  formalist arguments of the New Critics, but by thematic
                  considerations. It was precisely because Eliot knew Pound to
                  be well-informed about the occult that he asked far his
                  assistance with The Waste Land.},

                  writers, artists and intellectuals had abandoned Christianity,
                  and many had abandoned belief in God altogether. A.N. Wilson
                  demonstrates through such diverse lives as those of Gibbon,
                  Kant, and Marx, the doubt about religion had many sources. By
                  1900 the Church was vastly rich and powerful, but was seen by
                  many as spiritually empty, however full its pews might be of a
                  Sunday. Echoes of the death of God could be heard everywhere;
                  in the revolutionary politics of Garibaldi and Lenin; in the
                  poetry of Tennyson, the plays of Shaw and the novels of Hardy;
                  in the philosophy of Hegel and in the work of Freud; in the
                  first stirrings of feminism. Wilson's fascinating and
                  challenging account shows how the decline of religious
                  certainty in Victorian times had its origins with the
                  eighteenth-century sceptics - but brought a devastating sense

                  writer, H.D., this volume explores the nexus of the religious,
                  the visionary, the creative and the material. Drawing on
                  original archival research and analyses of newly published and
                  currently unpublished writings by H.D., Elizabeth Anderson
                  shows how the poet's work is informed by a range of religious
                  traditions, from the complexities and contradictions of
                  Moravian Christianity to a wide range of esoteric beliefs and
                  practices. H.D and Modernist Religious Imagination brings
                  H.D.'s texts into dialogue with the French theorist Hélène
                  Cixous, whose attention to writing, imagination and the sacred
                  has been a neglected, but rich, critical and theological

  abstract =     {The culture of fin de sicle Vienna continues to fascinate and
                  has been examined at length. There are indeed massive studies
                  of Freud, Mahler, Loos, Klimt, and many other notables from
                  that era. But these studies often ignore the religious
                  dimension of Viennese modernist culture, implying -- if not
                  arguing outright -- that "modernism" and "religion" are
                  contrary, even hostile, categories. Taking a different tack,
                  Robert Weldon Whalen in Sacred Spring documents the important
                  thesis that Viennese modernism, far from being secular, was in
                  fact a deeply religious movement. In vivid language Whalen
                  examines this era of "being torn apart and rising again,"
                  describing those Viennese who were on the cutting edge of
                  modern art and thought. Though the book focuses on avant-garde
                  art, it also connects materials from journalism, popular
                  culture, and contemporary politics in fascinating ways.
                  Students of modernism, the arts, and European cultural history
                  will find that Sacred Spring offers an intriguing, compelling
                  perspective on their subjects. Featuring a beautifully written
                  narrative, the book will also appeal to readers interested in
                  the intersection of culture and faith, in the connection
                  between the arts and the sacred.},

                  continuing impact of Christianity upon the cultural movement
                  known as Modernism. It defends the view that any theoretical,
                  historical, or critical discussion of Modernism that neglects

  abstract =     {The modernist period witnessed attempts to explain religious
                  experience in non-religious terms. Such novelists as Henry
                  James, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Franz
                  Kafka found methods to describe through fiction the sorts of
                  experiences that had traditionally been the domain of
                  religious mystics and believers. In Religious Experience and
                  the Modernist Novel, Pericles Lewis considers the development
                  of modernism in the novel in relation to changing attitudes to
                  religion. Through comparisons of major novelists with
                  sociologists and psychologists from the same period, Lewis
                  identifies the unique ways that literature addressed the
                  changing spiritual situation of the early twentieth century.
                  He challenges accounts that assume secularisation as the main
                  narrative for understanding twentieth-century literature.
                  Lewis explores the experiments that modernists undertook in
                  order to invoke the sacred without directly naming it,
                  resulting in a compelling study for readers of

                  become such a dominant and influential posture in contemporary
                  philosophical and theological writing. The author notes the
                  presence of the word "after" in a great many contemporary
                  academic titles, and notes a spiritual sort of alienation that
                  many feel in the "modern age." Out of this scholarly
                  discontent emerges one of two related attempts: the attempt to
                  return to a premodern manner of thinking and being
                  (nostalgia); and the playful flight into some vaguely defined
                  "postmodernity" (utopia). In either case, the common
                  perception is that modernity is a problem, a problem to be
                  avoided or escaped.Bringing philosophical and theological
                  texts into conversation with one another, the book discovers a
                  startling similarity in the accounts of modernness offered in
                  these disparate idioms. Both are telling a story - a story
                  which, the author argues, is as seductive as it is misguided.},

  abstract =     {The delicate and evocative word "passade" sprays a mist of
                  romance over what our blunter era calls a fling, a one-night
                  stand, a hook-up or, more often, an affair. "Passade" derives
                  from a fifteenth-century French term meaning "portion of a
                  game." At various times the same word has described a certain
                  move in fencing, an exercise in horsemanship, and a gift of
                  alms to a stranger. The fourth meaning cited in the OED, the
                  one that appears here and there in literature, is "a brief
                  romance." You can find it in Byron, Edith Wharton, and P.G.
                  Wodehouse. It was a key word in the vocabulary of H.G. Wells,
                  a prolific and grandly successful author in the first half of
                  the twentieth century, also renowned (in a somewhat less
                  public way) for his ambitious and spectacularly extensive sex
                  life. Her negative review of a Wells novel, Marriage, so
                  intrigued him that he invited her to lunch. Soon they were
                  lovers. In bed she called him "Iaguar," and he called her
                  "Panther." The intensity of their lovemaking was matched by
                  the ferocity of their arguments. Wells could be irascible, but
                  West was capable of monumental anger. She was easily hurt and
                  managed to be hurt many times by almost everyone she knew. A
                  London journalist, Charles Curran, diagnosed her as a case of
                  "psychological haemophilia." She bled profusely at the
                  slightest prick of criticism. "Like many people so afflicted,
                  she was wholly unaware that others could also bleed." Early in
                  the twentieth century there was no established social protocol
                  for "single mother." As a boy [Anthony West] lived with
                  [Rebecca West], but she had no idea how to talk to him about
                  their situation. Sometimes she asked that he treat her as his
                  aunt when others were around. Wells came to visit them but
                  never for long; he was to be called "Wellsie," not "Father."
                  Some friends and servants knew the truth; others didn't know
                  or were asked to hide their knowledge. Anthony found himself
                  conscripted to play a role in a drama where the script was
                  always changing. He was made to feel that he was an
                  inconvenience to his mother, and he resented the frequent
                  absences her working life required. In later years she claimed
                  that she had always been a good mother, but one of her
                  biographers remarked: "Rebecca eventually admitted that
                  sending Anthony away to school at the age of three was a
                  mistake." When he turned out to be a less than admirable
                  student she did not hide her dissatisfaction.},

                  of Dr. Moreau" depends on whether you figure he and Marlon
                  Brando are kidding around. The picture has Brando, as Moreau,
                  dolled up in gauzy full-body sundresses and hoods beneath
                  exaggerated lacy hats and veils (Brando also did drag in "The
                  Missouri Breaks" years ago). To accessorize his filmy attire,
                  Brando affects a squeaky, lispy British accent. If he and
                  Frankenheimer are serious about this stuff - I particularly
                  like the galvanized bucket/hat atop Moreau's head - the film
                  stands in grave trouble. If they're playing with the old H.G.
                  Wells story, there may be some method to this over-the-top
                  affair. The Wells novel has been filmed before, as "The Island
                  of Lost Souls" in 1933 and as "The Island of Dr. Moreau" in
                  1977. In all three versions, a great scientist gone bad tries
                  to create an improved humanity through genetic experiments

  isbn =         {978-1-135-06869-1},
  abstract =     {This Classic Edition of the best-selling textbook offers an
                  in-depth overview of approaches to the study of memory. With
                  empirical research from both the real world and the
                  neuropsychological clinic, the book explains the fundamental
                  workings of human memory in a clear and accessible style.~This
                  edition contains a new introduction and concluding chapter in
                  which the author reflects on how the book is organized, and
                  also on how the field of memory has developed since it was
                  first published. Essentials of Human Memory evolved from a
                  belief that, although the amount we know about memory has
                  increased enormously in recent years, it is still possible to
                  explain it in a way that would be fully understood by the
                  general reader. After a broad overview of approaches to the
                  study of memory, short-term and working memory are discussed,
                  followed by learning, the role of organizing in remembering
                  and factors influencing forgetting, including emotional
                  variables and claims for the role of repression in what has
                  become known as the false memory syndrome. The way in which
                  knowledge of the world is stored is discussed next, followed
                  by an account of the processes underlying retrieval, and their
                  application to the practical issues of eyewitness testimony.
                  The breakdown of memory in the amnesic syndrome is discussed
                  next, followed by discussion of the way in which memory
                  develops in children, and declines in the elderly. After a
                  section concerned with mnemonic techniques and memory
                  improvement, the book ends with an overview of recent
                  developments in the field of human memory. Written by the
                  leading expert in human memory, recently awarded the British
                  Psychological Society Research Board Lifetime Achievement
                  Award, Essentials of Human Memory will be of interest to
                  students of Cognitive Psychology, Neuropsychology, and anyone
                  with an interest in the workings of memory.},

                  to text reuse and derivation, especially in the context of
                  newspapers using newswire sources. Although the reuse of text
                  by journalists has been studied in linguistics, we are not
                  aware of any investigation using existing computational
                  methods for this particular task. We investigate the
                  classification of newspaper articles according to their degree
                  of dependence upon, or derivation from, a newswire source
                  using a simple 3-level scheme designed by journalists. Three
                  approaches to measuring text similarity are considered: n-gram
                  overlap, Greedy String Tiling, and sentence alignment.
                  Measured against a manually annotated corpus of source and
                  derived news text, we show that a combined classifier with
                  features automatically selected performs best overall for the
                  ternary classification achieving an average F1-measure score
                  of 0.664 across all three categories.},

  abstract =     {Waka is a form of traditional Japanese poetry with a 1300-year
                  history. In this paper, we attempt to semi-automatically
                  discover instances of poetic allusion, or more generally, to
                  find similar poems in anthologies of Waka poems. One
                  reasonable approach would be to arrange all possible pairs of
                  poems in two anthologies in decreasing order of similarity
                  values, and to scrutinize high-ranked pairs by human effort.
                  The means of defining similarity between Waka poems plays a
                  key role in this approach. In this paper, we generalize
                  existing (dis)similarity measures into a uniform framework,
                  called string resemblance systems, and using this framework,
                  we develop new similarity measures suitable for finding
                  similar poems. Using the measures, we report successful
                  results in finding instances of poetic allusion between two
                  anthologies Kokin-Shū and Shin-Kokin-Shū. Most interestingly,
                  we have found an instance of poetic allusion that has never
                  before been pointed out in the long history of Waka research.},

                  The Dutch dialect map based on a syntactic measure will be
                  compared with a dialect map based on subjective judgements and
                  a dialect map based on pronunciation differences to put the
                  syntactic measurement results into perspective. An alternative
                  way to measure syntactic distance will be presented and will
                  provide indications for future research to more accurately
                  quantify syntactic variation.},

  url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1835449.1835687},
  abstract = {Plagiarism, the unacknowledged reuse of text, has increased in recent years due to the large amount of texts readily available. For instance, recent studies claim that nowadays a high rate of student reports include plagiarism, making manual plagiarism detection practically infeasible. Automatic plagiarism detection tools assist experts to analyse documents for plagiarism. Nevertheless, the lack of standard collections with cases of plagiarism has prevented accurate comparing models, making differences hard to appreciate. Seminal efforts on the detection of text reuse [2] have fostered the composition of standard resources for the accurate evaluation and comparison of methods. The aim of this PhD thesis is to address three of the main problems in the development of better models for automatic plagiarism detection: (i) the adequate identification of good potential sources for a given suspicious text; (ii) the detection of plagiarism despite modifications, such as words substitution and paraphrasing (special stress is given to cross-language plagiarism); and (iii) the generation of standard collections of cases of plagiarism and text reuse in order to provide a framework for accurate comparison of models. Regarding difficulties (i) and (ii) , we have carried out preliminary experiments over the METER corpus [2]. Given a suspicious document dq and a collection of potential source documents D, the process is divided in two steps. First, a small subset of potential source documents D* in D is retrieved. The documents d in D* are the most related to dq and, therefore, the most likely to include the source of the plagiarised fragments in it. We performed this stage on the basis of the Kullback-Leibler distance, over a subsample of document's vocabularies. Afterwards, a detailed analysis is carried out comparing dq to every d in D* in order to identify potential cases of plagiarism and their source. This comparison was made on the basis of word n-grams, by considering n = \{2, 3\}. These n-gram levels are flexible enough to properly retrieve plagiarised fragments and their sources despite modifications [1]. The result is offered to the user to take the final decision. Further experiments were done in both stages in order to compare other similarity measures, such as the cosine measure, the Jaccard coefficient and diverse fingerprinting and probabilistic models. One of the main weaknesses of currently available models is that they are unable to detect cross-language plagiarism. Approaching the detection of this kind of plagiarism is of high relevance, as the most of the information published is written in English, and authors in other languages may find it attractive to make use of direct translations. Our experiments, carried out over parallel and a comparable corpora, show that models of "standard" cross-language information retrieval are not enough. In fact, if the analysed source and target languages are related in some way (common linguistic ancestors or technical vocabulary), a simple comparison based on character n-grams seems to be the option. However, in those cases where the relation between the implied languages is weaker, other models, such as those based on statistical machine translation, are necessary [3]. We plan to perform further experiments, mainly to approach the detection of cross-language plagiarism. In order to do that, we will use the corpora developed under the framework of the PAN competition on plagiarism detection (cf. PAN@CLEF: http://pan.webis.de). Models that consider cross-language thesauri and comparison of cognates will also be applied.},

                  near-duplicate documents, has been a focus of researchers
                  because of its importance in Web search. Local text reuse
                  occurs when sentences, facts or passages, rather than whole
                  documents, are reused and modified. Detecting this type of
                  reuse can be the basis of new tools for text analysis. In this

                  reuse and compare it to other approaches. This comparison

                  copying texts to adopting ideas, without giving credit to its
                  originator. This paper presents a new taxonomy of plagiarism
                  that highlights differences between literal plagiarism and
                  intelligent plagiarism, from the plagiarist's behavioral point
                  of view. The taxonomy supports deep understanding of different
                  linguistic patterns in committing plagiarism, for example,
                  changing texts into semantically equivalent but with different
                  words and organization, shortening texts with concept
                  generalization and specification, and adopting ideas and
                  important contributions of others. Different textual features
                  that characterize different plagiarism types are discussed.
                  Systematic frameworks and methods of monolingual, extrinsic,
                  intrinsic, and cross-lingual plagiarism detection are surveyed
                  and correlated with plagiarism types, which are listed in the
                  taxonomy. We conduct extensive study of state-of-the-art
                  techniques for plagiarism detection, including character
                  n-gram-based (CNG), vector-based (VEC), syntax-based (SYN),

                  (STRUC), stylometric-based (STYLE), and cross-lingual
                  techniques (CROSS). Our study corroborates that existing
                  systems for plagiarism detection focus on copying text but
                  fail to detect intelligent plagiarism when ideas are presented
                  in different words.},

                  now stands as one of the great literary achievements of the
                  twentieth century. Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the novel
                  traces the paths of Leopold Bloom and other Dubliners through
                  an ordinary summer day and night in 1904 — a typical day,
                  transformed by Joyce's narrative powers into an epic
                  celebration of life.First editions of Ulysses rank among the
                  modern rare book trade's most valuable finds. This reprint of
                  the original edition is not only the least expensive version
                  available but also the truest to the author's vision. Many
                  experts have reinterpreted the novel's surviving drafts to
                  produce revised texts, but this edition remains the version
                  that Joyce himself reviewed and corrected prior to the initial
                  publication. A new Introduction by Joyce scholar Enda Duffy

                  annotations to Joyce's great modern classic comprise a
                  specialized encyclopedia that will inform any reading of
                  Ulysses. Annotations in this edition are keyed both to the
                  reading text of the new critical edition of Ulysses published
                  in 1984 and to the standard 1961 Random House edition and the
                  current Modern Library and Vintage texts. Gifford has
                  incorporated over 1,000 additions and corrections to the first
                  edition. The introduction and headnotes to sections provide
                  general geographical, biographical and historical background.
                  The annotations gloss place names, define slang terms, give
                  capsule histories of institutions and political and cultural
                  movements and figures, supply bits of local and Irish legend
                  and lore, explain religious nomenclature and practices, trace
                  literary allusions and references to other cultures. The
                  suggestive potential of minor details was enormously
                  fascinating to Joyce, and the precision of his use of detail
                  is a most important aspect of his literary method. The
                  annotations in this volume illuminate details which are not in
                  the public realm for most of us.},

  abstract =     {Declared worthless and dehumanizing by James Baldwin in 1949,
                  Uncle Tom's Cabin has lacked literary credibility for fifty
                  years. Now, in a ringing refutation of Baldwin, Henry Louis
                  Gates Jr. demonstrates the literary transcendence of Harriet
                  Beecher Stowe's masterpiece. Uncle Tom's Cabin, first
                  published in 1852, galvanized the American public as no other
                  work of fiction has ever done. The editors animate pre-Civil
                  War life with rich insights into the lives of slaves,
                  abolitionists, and the American reading public. Examining the
                  lingering effects of the novel, they provide new insights into
                  emerging race-relation, women's, gay, and gender issues. With
                  reproductions of rare prints, posters, and photographs, this
                  book is also one of the most thorough anthologies of Uncle Tom

                  appeared in 1934, when Wells was sixty-eight years old, and is
                  presented in Faber Finds in two volumes (also in the Faber
                  Finds imprint is H. G. Wells in Love, which Wells drafted as
                  'Postscript to an Experiment in Autobiography' and can be read
                  as an accompaniment to these volumes). In these volumes, Wells
                  relates his early life, student days, struggles to make a
                  living, ascent to literary supremacy, and later career as
                  prophet of socialism. We follow him from the beginnings of his
                  thoughts to his crowning conclusion 'This particular brain ...
                  has arrived at the establishment of the Socialist World-State
                  as its directive purpose and has made that its religion and
                  end.' On reading this remarkable account, President Roosevelt
                  wrote to Wells to say: 'An Experiment in Autobiography was for
                  me an experiment in staying awake instead of putting the light
                  out. How do you manage to retain such vivid pictures of events
                  and such extraordinarily clear impressions and judgements?'

                  Rite of Spring in 1913 to the death of Hitler in 1945. "The
                  Great War," as Modris Eksteins writes, "was the psychological
                  turning point . . . for modernism as a whole. The urge to
                  create and the urge to destroy had changed places." In this
                  "bold and fertile book" (Atlantic Monthly), Eksteins goes on
                  to chart the seismic shifts in human consciousness brought
                  about by this great cataclysm through the lives and words of
                  ordinary people, works of literature, and such events as
                  Lindbergh's transatlantic flight and the publication of the

  abstract =     {If Aristotle sought to understand time through change, might
                  we not reverse the procedure and seek to understand change
                  through time? Once we do this, argues Peter Osborne, it soon
                  becomes clear that ideas such as avant-garde, modern,
                  postmodern and tradition—which are usually only treated as
                  markets for empirically discrete periods, movements or
                  styles—are best understood as categories of historical
                  totalization. More specifically, Osborne claims, such ideas
                  involve distinct "temporalizations" of history, giving rise to
                  conflicting politics of time. His book begins with a
                  consideration of the main aspects of modernity and develops
                  though a series of critical engagements with the major
                  twentieth-century positions in the philosophy of history. He
                  concludes with a fascinating history of the avant-garde
                  intervention into the temporality of everyday life in
                  surrealism, the situationists and the work of Henri Lefebvre.},

  abstract =     {During the 20th century, Italy experienced some regrettable
                  political developments. It was the first European nation after
                  World War I in which a mass militia-party of revolutionary
                  nationalism achieved power and abolished parliamentary
                  democracy with the goal of building a totalitarian state. It
                  was also the first in Europe to institutionalize the
                  sacralization of politics and to celebrate officially the cult
                  of the leader as a demi-God. These achievements were not
                  accidents. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Italian
                  nationalist movements, from the national radicalism of La Voce
                  to futurist nationalism and fascism, fostered one of the
                  strongest waves of European right-wing radicalism.The
                  confrontation between nationalism and modernity is one of the
                  main keys to understanding to the permutations of Italian
                  radical nationalism from modernist avant-gardes up to the
                  fascist regime. This book analyzes the ideological
                  undercurrents and cultural myths that unite all these
                  movements. Looking at Italian nationalism from its
                  risorgimento roots to the neo-fascist heritage, Gentile
                  considers the relationship between myth and organization in
                  the making of the fascist state, the role of the party, the
                  liturgy of mass politics in Italy, the fascist organizations
                  abroad, and the attitude of fascist culture toward the United
                  States.},

  abstract =     {Investigating the central role that theories of the visual
                  arts and creativity played in the development of fascism in
                  France, Mark Antliff examines the aesthetic dimension of
                  fascist myth-making within the history of the avant-garde.
                  Between 1909 and 1939, a surprising array of modernists were
                  implicated in this project, including such well-known figures
                  as the symbolist painter Maurice Denis, the architects Le
                  Corbusier and Auguste Perret, the sculptors Charles Despiau
                  and Aristide Maillol, the “New Vision” photographer Germaine
                  Krull, and the fauve Maurice Vlaminck.Antliff considers three
                  French fascists: Georges Valois, Philippe Lamour, and Thierry
                  Maulnier, demonstrating how they appropriated the avant-garde
                  aesthetics of cubism, futurism, surrealism, and the so-called
                  Retour à l’Ordre (“Return to Order”), and, in one instance,
                  even defined the “dynamism” of fascist ideology in terms of
                  Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein’s theory of montage. For
                  these fascists, modern art was the mythic harbinger of a
                  regenerative revolution that would overthrow existing
                  governmental institutions, inaugurate an anticapitalist new
                  order, and awaken the creative and artistic potential of the
                  fascist “new man.”In formulating the nexus of fascist
                  ideology, aesthetics, and violence, Valois, Lamour, and
                  Maulnier drew primarily on the writings of the French
                  political theorist Georges Sorel, whose concept of
                  revolutionary myth proved central to fascist theories of
                  cultural and national regeneration in France. Antliff analyzes
                  the impact of Sorel’s theory of myth on Valois, Lamour, and
                  Maulnier. Valois created the first fascist movement in France;
                  Lamour, a follower of Valois, established the short-lived
                  Parti Fasciste Révolutionnaire in 1928 before founding two
                  fascist-oriented journals; Maulnier forged a theory of fascism
                  under the auspices of the journals Combat and Insurgé.},

  abstract =     {These essays reveal Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975)—known in the
                  West largely through his studies of Rabelais and Dostoevsky—as
                  a philosopher of language, a cultural historian, and a major
                  theoretician of the novel. The Dialogic Imagination presents,
                  in superb English translation, four selections from Voprosy
                  literatury i estetiki (Problems of literature and esthetics),
                  published in Moscow in 1975. The volume also contains a
                  lengthy introduction to Bakhtin and his thought and a glossary
                  of terminology.Bakhtin uses the category \&quot;novel\&quot;
                  in a highly idiosyncratic way, claiming for it vastly larger
                  territory than has been traditionally accepted. For him, the
                  novel is not so much a genre as it is a force,
                  \&quot;novelness,\&quot; which he discusses in \&quot;From the
                  Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse.\&quot; Two essays,

                  in Bakhtin\&\#39;s own unorthodox way. In the final essay, he
                  discusses literature and language in general, which he sees as
                  stratified, constantly changing systems of subgenres,
                  dialects, and fragmented \&quot;languages\&quot; in battle

                  music. The catastrophe of the First World War, the emergence

                  a movement that aspired to transform culture.},

  abstract =     {"Modernism: An Anthology" is the most comprehensive anthology
                  of Anglo-American modernism ever to be published. The giants
                  of modernist literature - James Joyce, Gertrude Stein,
                  Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens,
                  Marianne Moore, Samuel Beckett - are amply represented, along
                  with another 20 Anglo-American writers. In addition, the book
                  features a generous selection of texts by avant-garde thinkers
                  and writers from the Continent. These enable the reader to
                  trace modernism's interaction with the Futurists, the
                  Dadaists, the Surrealists, and the Frankfurt School. Supported
                  by helpful annotations and an extensive bibliography, this
                  "Anthology" allows readers to encounter anew the extraordinary
                  revolution in language that utterly transformed the aesthetics

  abstract =     {He's one of the most controversial thinkers of the 19th
                  century: Nietzsche and his works have been by turns vilified,
                  lauded, and subjected to numerous contradictory
                  interpretations, and yet he remains a figure of profound
                  important, and his works a necessary component of a
                  well-rounded education.In this 1873 essay, Nietzsche discusses
                  the inevitably subjective lenses through which we see,
                  explore, examine, and lend meaning to the events and
                  characters of the past. As we find ourselves plunged into
                  times that feel of urgent and "historic" significance,
                  Nietzsche's reflections and speculations are newly
                  provocative, whether we agree with them or not.German
                  psychologist and philosopher FRIEDRICH WILHELM NIETZSCHE
                  (1844-1900) was appointed special professor of classical
                  philology at the University of Basel at the precocious age of
                  24, but soon found himself dissatisfied with academic life and
                  created an alternative intellectual society for himself among
                  friends including composer Richard Wagner, historian Jakob
                  Burckhardt, and theologian Franz Overbeck. Among his
                  philosophical works are Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good
                  and Evil, and Ecce Homo.},

                  course of a long career, are marked by their engaging flair
                  and independence from intellectual fashion. They often explore
                  aspects of the interaction of craftsmanship and ideas that are
                  unnoticed or ignored in the mainstream of critical debate.
                  However, the full potential of his approach only emerges when
                  these essays are taken together. A notable concern of Brown’s
                  critical method is to uncover the latent organising principles
                  - naturally as various as the author’s intentions - that lie
                  beneath the surface of any worthwhile extended literary work.
                  His ‘sightings’ reveal the actual contours of literary
                  landscapes seen dimly before.},

  abstract =     {A classic study of the beliefs and institutions of mankind,
                  and the progress through magic and religion to scientific
                  thought, The Golden Bough has a unique status in modern
                  anthropology and literature. First published in 1890, The
                  Golden Bough was eventually issued in a twelve-volume edition
                  (1906-15) which was abridged in 1922 by the author and his
                  wife. That abridgement has never been reconsidered for a
                  modern audience. In it some of the more controversial passages
                  were dropped, including Frazer's daring speculations on the
                  Crucifixion of Christ. For the first time this one-volume
                  edition restores Frazer's bolder theories and sets them within
                  the framework of a valuable introduction and notes. A seminal
                  work of modern anthropolgy, The Golden Bough also influenced
                  many twentieth-century writers, including D H Lawrence, T S
                  Eliot, and Wyndham Lewis. Its discussion of magical types, the
                  sacrificial killing of kings, the dying god, and the scapegoat
                  is given fresh pertinence in this new edition. ABOUT THE
                  SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made
                  available the widest range of literature from around the

                  scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of
                  other valuable features, including expert introductions by

  abstract =     {'A good essay must draw its curtain round us, but it must be a
                  curtain that shuts us in, not out.' According to Virginia
                  Woolf, the goal of the essay 'is simply that it should give
                  pleasure...It should lay us under a spell with its first word,
                  and we should only wake, refreshed, with its last.' One of the
                  best practitioners of the art she analysed so rewardingly,
                  Woolf displayed her essay-writing skills across a wide range
                  of subjects, with all the craftsmanship, substance, and rich
                  allure of her novels. This selection brings together thirty of
                  her best essays, including the famous 'Mr Bennett and Mrs
                  Brown', a clarion call for modern fiction. She discusses the
                  arts of writing and of reading, and the particular role and
                  reputation of women writers. She writes movingly about her
                  father and the art of biography, and of the London scene in
                  the early decades of the twentieth century. Overall, these
                  pieces are as indispensable to an understanding of this great
                  writer as they are enchanting in their own right.},

                  Addison, and others?not only knew their classics well, they
                  took them seriously as models of literary excellence and
                  repositories of values. In the twentieth century, however, the
                  classics have become mere ?background.? As a consequence,
                  William M. Porter argues, not only is the foundational
                  dimension of Milton?s poetry now hardly visible, even to
                  scholars, but the potential of Milton?s poetry to revitalize
                  the reading of the classics has been diminished. In this
                  insightful study, Porter attempts once again to read both the
                  classics and Milton?s epic poem sensitively and intelligently.
                  He exposes the recklessly speculative and tendentious
                  character of much earlier work on Milton?s allusions, in which
                  allusions were promiscuously posited and in which Paradise
                  Lost was too often regarded naively as triumphing over the
                  classics. Porter demonstrates that Milton?s allusions, in
                  which allusions to the classics, while fewer than has been
                  supposed, are rich with wit, irony, and thought that can be
                  grasped only by a reader with a double perspective.},

  shorttitle =   {Surprised by {{Sin}}},
  abstract =     {In 1967 the world of Milton studies was divided into two armed
                  camps: one proclaiming (in the tradition of Blake and Shelley)
                  that Milton was of the devil's party with or without knowing
                  it, the other proclaiming (in the tradition of Addison and C.
                  S. Lewis) that the poet's sympathies are obviously with God
                  and the angels loyal to him. The achievement of Stanley Fish's
                  Surprised by Sin was to reconcile the two camps by subsuming
                  their claims in a single overarching thesis: Paradise Lost is
                  a poem about how its readers came to be the way they are--that
                  is, fallen--and the poem's lesson is proven on a reader's
                  impulse every time he or she finds a devilish action
                  attractive or a godly action dismaying. Fish's argument
                  reshaped the face of Milton studies; thirty years later the
                  issues raised in Surprised by Sin continue to set the agenda

                  Milton as a poet of absolute, unquestioning certainty. In
                  Paradise Lost , Milton confronts the failure of the Revolution
                  by creating a poem that refuses to grant the reader any
                  interpretive stability or certainty. Doubts can no longer be
                  contained and concepts once marked by a 'fundamental
                  immobility' now seem unstable at best. Paradise Regained and
                  Samson Agonistes equally reflect Milton's deep ambivalences
                  after the collapse of the Republic. Far from confirming his
                  earlier ideals, in his later poetry, Milton subjects his
                  culture's most cherished beliefs, such as the goodness of God,
                  to withering scrutiny, while refusing the comfort of orthodox

                  material essential to students for a proper understanding of

  shorttitle =   {Milton's {{Languages}}},
  abstract =     {Milton's poetry is one of the glories of the English language,
                  and yet it owes everything to Milton's widespread knowledge of
                  other languages: he knew ten, wrote in four, and translated
                  from five. In Milton's Languages, John K. Hale first examines
                  Milton's language-related arts in verse-composition,
                  translations, annotations of Greek poets, Latin prose and
                  political polemic, giving all relevant texts in the original
                  and in translation. Hale then traces the impact of Milton's
                  multilingualism on his major English poems. Many vexed
                  questions of Milton studies are illuminated by this approach,
                  including his sense of vocation, his attitude to print and
                  publicity, the supposed blemish of Latinism in his poetry, and
                  his response to his literary predecessors. Throughout this
                  full-length study of Milton's use of languages, Hale argues
                  convincingly that it is only by understanding Milton's choice
                  among languages that we can grasp where Milton's own unique
                  English originated.},

  abstract =     {H.G. Wells’s 1909 novel centres on the coming of age of the
                  spirited Ann Veronica, who runs away from her sheltered
                  suburban home to live in London. There she mingles with
                  feminists, studies biology, learns jiu jitsu, and even
                  participates in a suffragette raid on the House of Commons
                  that lands her in jail. When originally published, the novel
                  was deemed “poisonous” for its bold treatment of an adulterous
                  romance that only lightly veiled Wells’s extramarital affairs.
                  While critics debate whether the shift to romance undermines
                  the novel’s feminist themes, readers continue to be engaged by
                  its vividly realized heroine and its rich portrayal of the
                  tumultuous social movements of Edwardian London. Historical
                  documents expand on the novel’s autobiographical dimension
                  with letters between Wells and Amber Reeves, the model for Ann
                  Veronica; also included are materials on the suffrage
                  movement, attempts to censor the novel, and the New Woman.},

                  in his name, and focused on a mode of interrogation against

                  authorial style variation. This study uses several such
                  techniques to explore the traditional distinction between
                  James's early and late styles. They confirm this distinction,
                  identify an intermediate style, and facilitate an analysis of
                  the lexical character of James's style. Especially revealing
                  are techniques that identify words with extremely variable
                  frequencies across James's oeuvre–words that clearly
                  characterize the various period styles. Such words
                  disproportionately increase or decrease steadily throughout
                  James's remarkably unidirectional stylistic development.
                  Stylometric techniques constitute a promising avenue of
                  research that exploits the power of corpus analysis and
                  returns our attention to a manageable subset of an author's

                  writings using stylometry, or the quantitative study of
                  writing style, focusing on grammatical function words, a
                  linguistic category that has seldom been studied before in
                  Beckett studies. To these function words, we apply methods
                  from computational stylometry and model the stylistic
                  evolution in Beckett's oeuvre. Our analyses reveal a number of
                  discoveries that shed new light on existing periodizations in
                  the secondary literature, which commonly distinguish an
                  “early,” “middle,” and “late” period in Beckett's oeuvre. We
                  analyze Beckett's prose writings in both English and French,
                  demonstrating notable symmetries and asymmetries between both
                  languages. The analyses nuance the traditional three-part
                  periodization as they show the possibility of stylistic
                  relapses (disturbing the linearity of most periodizations) as
                  well as different turning points depending on the language of
                  the corpus, suggesting that Beckett's English oeuvre is not

  abstract =     {The evolution of fairy tales often involves complex
                  interactions between oral and literary traditions, which can
                  be difficult to tease apart when investigating their origins.
                  Here, we show how computer-assisted stemmatology can be
                  productively applied to this problem, focusing on a
                  long-standing controversy in fairy tale scholarship: did
                  Little Red Riding Hood originate as an oral tale that was
                  adapted by Perrault and the Brothers Grimm, or is the oral
                  tradition in fact derived from literary texts? We address this
                  question by analysing a sample of twenty-four literal and oral
                  versions of the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood using
                  several methods of phylogenetic analysis, including maximum
                  parsimony and two network-based approaches (NeighbourNet and
                  TRex). While the results of these analyses are more compatible
                  with the oral origins hypothesis than the alternative literary
                  origins hypothesis, their interpretation is problematized by
                  the fact that none of them explicitly model lineal (i.e.
                  ancestor-descendent) relationships among taxa. We therefore
                  present a new likelihood-based method, PhyloDAG, which was
                  specifically developed to model lineal as well as collateral
                  and reticulate relationships. A comparison of different
                  structures derived from PhyloDAG provided a much clearer
                  result than the maximum parsimony, NeighbourNet or TRex
                  analyses, and strongly favoured the hypothesis that literary
                  versions of Little Red Riding Hood were originally based on
                  oral folktales, rather than vice versa.},

                  (DSE) stands as a long-awaited and timely contribution to the
                  field. A valuable addition to an already vast canon on the
                  subject, it remains one of the rare instances of a systematic
                  investigation of a field which, while still undergoing a phase
                  of experimentation, has now reached a level of maturity that
                  begs for such a comprehensive analysis. By distancing itself
                  from historical and evaluative accounts as well as from a
                  ‘how-to’ guide to digital editing, the book advocates for a
                  ‘heightened awareness of medium as a methodological question’
                  in textual scholarship (Fraistat and Flanders, 2013, p. 1),
                  offering a detailed analysis of ‘the methodological
                  implications of the application of computational methods to
                  all stages of the editorial workflow’ (p. 1). This guiding
                  principle allows the author not only to deconstruct and
                  further challenge the persistent adherence to the ‘page
                  paradigm’ that brings digital editions to ‘only timidly
                  engag[e] with the medium’ (p. 2) but also to provide an
                  exemplary methodological analysis of DSE through modelling.
                  The first four chapters address theoretical aspects of DSE.
                  The book begins with a concise overview of traditional
                  editorial models. A number of emergent born-digital editorial
                  approaches, such as phylogenetic analysis, social editing,
                  crowdsourcing, and ergodic editions, are then discussed in
                  detail. Crowdsourcing activities, for instance, are classified
                  according to five parameters (context, participants, tasks,
                  quality control, and role in the project), while analysis of
                  the source-and-the-output model (paradigmatic editions) brings
                  the author to argue that encoding could blur the boundaries
                  between different types of editions (diplomatic, reading,
                  etc.). Established practices in the digital realm, such as the
                  side-by-side view discussed in the section devoted to
                  interactivity and gamification, are also challenged. The
                  chapter concludes with an examination of functional analyses
                  of DSEs. In the second chapter, the author applies …

  isbn =         {978-0-8122-0298-4},
  abstract =     {Because the stories in James Joyce's Dubliners seem to
                  function as models of fiction, they are able to stand in for
                  fiction in general in their ability to make the operation of
                  texts explicit and visible. Joyce's stories do this by
                  provoking skepticism in the face of their storytelling. Their
                  narrative unreliabilities—produced by strange gaps, omitted
                  scenes, and misleading narrative prompts—arouse suspicion and
                  oblige the reader to distrust how and why the story is told.As
                  a result, one is prompted to look into what is concealed,
                  omitted, or left unspoken, a quest that often produces
                  interpretations in conflict with what the narrative surface
                  suggests about characters and events. Margot Norris's strategy
                  in her analysis of the stories in Dubliners is to refuse to
                  take the narrative voice for granted and to assume that every
                  authorial decision to include or exclude, or to represent in a
                  particular way, may be read as motivated. Suspicious Readings
                  of Joyce's Dubliners examines the text for counterindictions
                  and draws on the social context of the writing in order to
                  offer readings from diverse theoretical
                  perspectives.Suspicious Readings of Joyce's Dubliners devotes
                  a chapter to each of the fifteen stories in Dubliners and
                  shows how each confronts the reader with an interpretive
                  challenge and an intellectual adventure. Its readings of "An
                  Encounter," "Two Gallants," "A Painful Case," "A Mother," "The
                  Boarding House," and "Grace" reconceive the stories in wholly
                  novel ways—ways that reveal Joyce's writing to be even more
                  brilliant, more exciting, and more seriously attuned to moral
                  and political issues than we had thought.},

                  it to be a kind of divine madness that can allow our souls to
                  grow wings and soar to their greatest heights. Then the

                  rhetoric, which must be based on truth passionately sought,

                  imperfection as possible.' Timaeus, one of Plato's
                  acknowledged masterpieces, is an attempt to construct the
                  universe and explain its contents by means of as few axioms as
                  possible. The result is a brilliant, bizarre, and surreal
                  cosmos - the product of the rational thinking of a creator god
                  and his astral assistants, and of purely mechanistic causes
                  based on the behaviour of the four elements. At times
                  dazzlingly clear, at times intriguingly opaque, this was
                  state-of-the-art science in the middle of the fourth century
                  BC. The world is presented as a battlefield of forces that are
                  unified only by the will of God, who had to do the best he
                  could with recalcitrant building materials. The unfinished
                  companion piece, Critias, is the foundational text for the
                  story of Atlantis. It tells how a model society became

                  aggression of the invading Atlanteans. This new edition

                  accessible, indispensible guide for anyone reading Joyce's
                  masterpiece for the first time.To ensure that Blamires'
                  classic work will remain useful to new readers, this third
                  edition contains the page numbering and references to three
                  commonly read editions of Ulysses: the Oxford University Press

                  comprise a specialized encyclopedia that will inform any
                  reading of Ulysses. The suggestive potential of minor details
                  was enormously fascinating to Joyce, and the precision of his
                  use of detail is a most important aspect of his literary
                  method. The annotations in this volume illuminate details
                  which are not in the public realm for most of us. The
                  annotations gloss place names, define slang terms, give
                  capsule histories of institutions and political and cultural
                  movements and figures, supply bits of local and Irish legend
                  and lore, explain religious nomenclature and practices, trace
                  literary allusions and references to other cultures.
                  Annotations are keyed not only to the reading text of the
                  critical edition of Ulysses, but to the standard 1961 Random

  abstract =     {Upon its publication in 1959, this book was recognized as the
                  definitive study of Joyce's life. In honor of the James Joyce
                  Centenary in 1982, the author published a new edition,
                  thoroughly revised and expanded. Ellmann's original research
                  led him from Dublin to Joyce's haunts in Europe. In the
                  process he discovered many people who served as partial models
                  for Joyce's characters, networks of association in which they
                  were placed, and he shows how Joyce converted this raw
                  material into brilliant works of fiction. Ellmann gives a
                  fascinating account of the literary milieu in which Joyce
                  worked, and discusses his relationship with Yeats, Shaw,
                  Eliot, Hemingway, Proust, Pound, Larbaud, and Fitzgerald. His
                  dramatic portrait of Joyce as son, lover, husband. father, and
                  artist provides the key to understanding Joyce's revolutionary
                  writings. This new edition, for a new generation, Ellmann
                  feels "may help to assuage some of the curiosity that still
                  persists about this bizarre and wonderful creature who turned
                  literature and language on its end."--Publisher description.},

                  biographical, and geographical background for Dubliners and

                  an American avant-garde magazine, The Little Review, between
                  1918 and 1920. The novel many consider to be the most
                  important literary work of the twentieth century was, at the
                  time, deemed obscene and scandalous, resulting in the eventual
                  seizure of The Little Review and the placing of a legal ban on
                  Joyce’s masterwork that would not be lifted in the United
                  States until 1933. For the first time, The Little Review
                  “Ulysses” brings together the serial installments of Ulysses
                  to create a new edition of the novel, enabling teachers,

                  languages to melodies and genomes - the mutual information
                  between two symbols decays roughly like a power law with the
                  number of symbols in between the two. In contrast, we prove
                  that Markov/hidden Markov processes generically exhibit
                  exponential decay in their mutual information, which explains
                  why natural languages are poorly approximated by Markov
                  processes. We present a broad class of models that naturally
                  reproduce this critical behavior. They all involve deep
                  dynamics of a recursive nature, as can be approximately
                  implemented by tree-like or recurrent deep neural networks.
                  This model class captures the essence of probabilistic
                  context-free grammars as well as recursive self-reproduction
                  in physical phenomena such as turbulence and cosmological

                  context: 1-dimensional "shallow" models (such as Markov models
                  or regular grammars) will fail to model natural language,
                  because they cannot exhibit criticality, whereas "deep" models

                  abstraction or scale can potentially succeed.},

  abstract =     {All museums are sex museums. In Sex Museums, Jennifer Tyburczy
                  takes a hard look at the formation of Western
                  sexuality—particularly how categories of sexual normalcy and
                  perversity are formed—and asks what role museums have played
                  in using display as a technique for disciplining sexuality.
                  Most museum exhibits, she argues, assume that white,
                  patriarchal heterosexuality and traditional structures of
                  intimacy, gender, and race represent national sexual culture
                  for their visitors. Sex Museums illuminates the history of
                  such heteronormativity at most museums and proposes
                  alternative approaches for the future of public display
                  projects, while also offering the reader curatorial
                  tactics—what she calls queer curatorship—for exhibiting
                  diverse sexualities in the twenty-first century. Tyburczy
                  shows museums to be sites of culture-war theatrics, where
                  dramatic civic struggles over how sex relates to public space,
                  genealogies of taste and beauty, and performances of sexual
                  identity are staged. Delving into the history of erotic
                  artifacts, she analyzes how museums have historically
                  approached the collection and display of the material culture
                  of sex, which poses complex moral, political, and logistical
                  dilemmas for the Western museum. Sex Museums unpacks the
                  history of the museum and its intersections with the history
                  of sexuality to argue that the Western museum context—from its
                  inception to the present—marks a pivotal site in the
                  construction of modern sexual subjectivity.},

                  States. This has been due, in no small degree, to the
                  influence of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's critically acclaimed
                  "Epistemology of the Closet. "Working from classic texts of

                  turn-of-the-century historical moment in which sexual
                  orientation became as important a demarcation of personhood as
                  gender had been for centuries. In her preface to this updated

                  historically, looking specifically at the horror of the first
                  wave of the AIDS epidemic and its influence on the text."},

  abstract =     {Bringing together leading critics and literary scholars, A New
                  Vocabulary for Global Modernism argues for new ways of
                  understanding the nature and development of twentieth-century
                  literature and culture. Scholars have largely understood
                  modernism as an American and European phenomenon. Those
                  parameters have expanded in recent decades, but the
                  incorporation of multiple origins and influences has often
                  been tied to older conceptual frameworks that make it
                  difficult to think of modernism globally. Providing
                  alternative approaches, A New Vocabulary for Global Modernism
                  introduces pathways through global archives and new frameworks
                  that offer a richer, more representative set of concepts for
                  the analysis of literary and cultural works. In separate
                  essays each inspired by a critical term, this collection
                  explores what happens to the foundational concepts of
                  modernism and the methods we bring to modernist studies when
                  we approach the field as a global phenomenon. Their work
                  transforms the intellectual paradigms we have long associated
                  with modernism, such as tradition, antiquity, style, and

  abstract =     {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the
                  content: Possible-Worlds Theory and Joyce's "Wandering Rocks":
                  The Case of Father Conmee Margot Norris (bio) The 1982
                  International James Joyce Symposium in Dublin celebrating the
                  centenary of Joyce's birth offered a reenactment of the
                  Ulysses episode called "Wandering Rocks." This chapter of the
                  novel looks at Dubliners going about their business during a
                  brief period on a Thursday afternoon in June 1904. During the
                  1982 reenactment, figures dressed in Edwardian costume
                  simultaneously acted out relevant scenes in various parts of
                  the city-with the intended result that no spectator could take
                  in more than a few of the dispersed segments of the episode.
                  This performance was complemented by other instances of
                  mapping the fiction onto the actual city, most notably by
                  fixing a plaque on Leopold Bloom's (fictitious) birthplace at
                  the house on 52 Clanbrassil Street. The moment testified to
                  the powerful realism of Joyce's work, whose fictional figures
                  become as real to us as once living persons. At the same time,
                  this commemoration marked a reversal of the more prevalent
                  relationship between fact and fiction in Ulysses, where large
                  numbers of historical personages mingle with fictional
                  characters. "Wandering Rocks" displays what Clive Hart in his
                  seminal 1974 essay called a "documentary reality."1 He
                  describes the ramification of the episode's relationship to
                  the city as "Joyce's most direct, most complete celebration of
                  Dublin, demonstrating succinctly his conception of the
                  importance of physical reality, meticulously documented, as
                  the soil from which fictions may best grow" (181). In this
                  documentary quality, Hart finds something more at stake in
                  "Wandering Rocks" than mere mimesis or literary realism. The
                  narration represents such a verifiable reporting of facts that
                  readers may construe the episode's failure to correspond to
                  the real world as "error" (197). These occasional [End Page
                  21] disjunctions between the real and the fictional world
                  create only one of a number of reader "traps," as Hart calls
                  them, which make reading the chapter a "dangerous imaginative
                  journey, in emulation of the Argosy" (188). I plan to revisit
                  some aspects of the "documentary reality" of "Wandering Rocks"
                  and the traps for the reader that it produces, in order to
                  explore them through an area in the field of narratology known
                  as the possible-worlds theory of fiction. The work of four
                  theorists will be particularly useful in pursuing these
                  issues: Lubomir Doležel's 1998 Heterocosmica: Fiction and
                  Possible Worlds, Ruth Ronen's 1994 Possible Worlds in Literary
                  Theory, Marie-Laure Ryan's 1991 Possible Worlds, Artificial
                  Intelligence, and Narrative Theory, and Thomas G. Pavel's 1986
                  Fictional Worlds.2 My hope is not only to explore the process
                  of world creation in "Wandering Rocks" but also to extend the
                  implications of possible-worlds theory for an ethics of
                  reading the episode. My counterpart to Hart's "reader traps"
                  will be ethical traps in the sense that they challenge reader
                  responsibility to be just-both to real and fictional persons,
                  as well as to the text itself. Possible-worlds theory allows
                  us to examine the episode's interplay between history and
                  fiction in a way that illuminates how fictional worlds are
                  constructed. How does "Wandering Rocks" reproduce not only the
                  actual characters that populate 1904 Dublin but also the
                  worlds created in and by their minds? And what is the
                  consequence of inventing imaginary, or possible, worlds for
                  fictional figures drawn from real life? Joyce's transformation
                  of the figure of Oliver St. John Gogarty into the fictional
                  persona of Malachi Mulligan resorts to the device of the roman
                  à clef-a strategy with its own ethical challenges and
                  pitfalls. Readers with the key to Mulligan's historical
                  counterpart can certainly take issue with the portrait,3 but
                  Mulligan is nonetheless presented as a fictional character.
                  But the Reverend Father John Conmee in "Wandering Rocks" is
                  given the name of the historical person and represented with
                  details that correspond factually to his biography, yet he is
                  endowed with thoughts that must of necessity be fictional.
                  Since these thoughts produced in the world of the novel are
                  potentially scandalous, they could incur an unjust defamation
                  of a highly placed historical Jesuit4 living in a situation
                  sufficiently modern...},

                  of 21,367 scholarly articles in literary studies from
                  1889–2013. Our approach reveals aspects of our disciplinary
                  history that have been occluded by existing histories’
                  emphasis on generational and methodological conflict. We
                  demonstrate gradual, unnoted shifts in the themes and
                  vocabularies of scholarship—including the long rise of new
                  subjects (like violence); we show the surprising novelty of
                  central theoretical concepts; and we explore transformations
                  in the shared rationales for literary scholarship that exceed
                  the boundaries of conventional labels like “New Criticism” and
                  “New Historicism.” Though our method uses computational tools,
                  we not claim to provide a definitive or objective perspective
                  on disciplinary history; instead, our approach, like the
                  related methods of content analysis in the social sciences,
                  allows us to pursue nuanced interpretations of the language of
                  many texts at once.},

                  paper we present an expressive model, suitable for paper and
                  electronic documents, that is based on a graph-like structure.
                  The principal concepts are the notions of abstract and
                  concrete objects, hierarchical composition of ordered and
                  unordered objects, sharing of components, and reference links.
                  This model has proven useful for specifying a wide variety of

  abstract =     {In the text-based disciplines, psychoanalysis and Marxism have
                  had a major influence on how we read, and this has been
                  expressed most consistently in the practice of symptomatic
                  reading, a mode of interpretation that assumes that a text's
                  truest meaning lies in what it does not say, describes textual
                  surfaces as superfluous, and seeks to unmask hidden meanings.
                  For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are
                  veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their
                  irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend
                  away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes
                  various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to
                  accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness.
                  Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the
                  kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the
                  complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been

  abstract =     {Forms offers a powerful new answer to one of the most pressing
                  problems facing literary, critical, and cultural studies
                  today—how to connect form to political, social, and historical
                  context. Caroline Levine argues that forms organize not only
                  works of art but also political life—and our attempts to know
                  both art and politics. Inescapable and frequently troubling,
                  forms shape every aspect of our experience. Yet, forms don't
                  impose their order in any simple way. Multiple shapes,
                  patterns, and arrangements, overlapping and colliding,
                  generate complex and unpredictable social landscapes that
                  challenge and unsettle conventional analytic models in
                  literary and cultural studies.Borrowing the concept of
                  "affordances" from design theory, this book investigates the
                  specific ways that four major forms—wholes, rhythms,
                  hierarchies, and networks—have structured culture, politics,
                  and scholarly knowledge across periods, and it proposes
                  exciting new ways of linking formalism to historicism and
                  literature to politics. Levine rereads both formalist and
                  antiformalist theorists, including Cleanth Brooks, Michel
                  Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Mary Poovey, and Judith Butler,
                  and she offers engaging accounts of a wide range of objects,
                  from medieval convents and modern theme parks to Sophocles’s
                  Antigone and the television series The Wire. The result is a
                  radically new way of thinking about form for the next
                  generation and essential reading for scholars and students
                  across the humanities who must wrestle with the problem of
                  form and context.},

                  Today the statistical analysis of literary styles is made much

                  Internet. This article presents an overview and brief history
                  of the analysis of literary styles. In addition we use
                  canonical discriminant analyis and principal component
                  analysis to identify structure in the data and distinguish

                  department as we know it today. In a readable and
                  often-amusing narrative, Gerald Graff shows that the heated
                  conflicts of our recent culture wars echo—and often
                  recycle—controversies over how literature should be taught
                  that began more than a century ago. Updated with a new preface
                  by the author that addresses many of the provocative arguments
                  raised by its initial publication, Professing Literature
                  remains an essential history of literary pedagogy and a
                  critical classic. “Graff’s history. . . is a pathbreaking
                  investigation showing how our institutions shape literary
                  thought and proposing how they might be changed.”— The Norton

                  literary scholarship since its publication in 1961, represents
                  a new and imaginative approach to the history and poetics of
                  the novel. Emil Staiger, dean of Swiss critics, describes
                  Professor Meyer as “ ... a literary historian, who has a sense
                  for the mixture of seriousness and playfulness in literature,
                  who can talk seriously about the play and ironically about the
                  seriousness ... who has at his disposal the most thorough
                  knowledge and never becomes ponderous ... writes easily and
                  gracefully.” The art of quoting is traced in Rabelais,
                  Cervantes, and Sterne, followed by the development of these
                  techniques in six major novelists from Wieland to Thomas

                  through the 1960s and 70s, when it posed an unprecedented
                  challenge to the literary establishment. Eagleton has added a

                  developments in literary studies, including what he describes

                  p. 151). This article employs citation analysis on a micro
                  level—the level of the cited document; in this case, Walter
                  Benjamin's Illuminations (1968/2007). The study shows how this
                  frequently cited publication—more than 4,000 citations in Web
                  of Science—has been received. The growth of citations and
                  interdisciplinary citing is studied, and a novel approach—page
                  citation analysis—is applied to study how different parts of

                  curves, i.e. curves of frequency of citations received vs.
                  time. The citation life of ten randomly selected Citation
                  Classics, five in medicine and five in biochemistry, are
                  studied longitudinally in time and compared with a random
                  sample of ten non-classics of the same cohort. There are
                  pronounced differences in the life cycle curves; two distinct
                  types are suggested. Type A, comprised of both high and low
                  cited papers in both fields, has an early peak of citation
                  rate and may be approximated by a bilinear cumulative citation
                  curve with a break at six years of age, when three quarters of
                  the total number of citations have occurred. Type B, in this
                  study comprised of extremely highly cited methodological
                  Citation Classics, exhibit a constant or slowly accelerating
                  growth rate with a vigorous citation life extending over the
                  entire period studied and typically one third or less of the

                  each reference counted as frequently as it was cited in the
                  randomly selected citations. The citations were classified as
                  to source type (book, article in book, journal article,
                  manuscript, thesis), language, the gender of both citing and
                  cited authors, the citing authors' attitudes toward the cited
                  material, the subject correlation between citing and cited
                  sources, and the chronology of the citations. The type of
                  presses publishing philosophy monographs and which journals
                  are cited are also discussed. While many contemporary
                  philosophers consider their discipline more related to the
                  sciences than to the humanities, their citation patterns are
                  typically humanistic, with the bulk of citations to books
                  rather than journal articles and the citation of much material
                  older than 20 years. The topics studied were found to be
                  predominantly 20th-century with an emphasis on analytic
                  philosophy and little concern for recent trends in continental
                  philosophy, except for feminist philosophy. A quarter of
                  citations were to disciplines outside philosophy.},

                  episode. It investigates unresolved aspects of Joyce
                  scholarship, such as the structure of Ulysses and Joyce's
                  narrative techniques, moving the reader toward a new
                  understanding of "Penelope." Ultimately, readers will
                  recognize that "Penelope" is not, in fact, the final episode
                  of Ulysses but rather an event that is akin to the claim "it's
                  the end of the world," or the end of Ulysses proper.
                  Traditional criticisms of the last episodes are contingent
                  upon the idea that Ulysses is a contiguous narrative about
                  Stephen and Bloom's relationship. However, this is not the
                  case. This essay demonstrates that with Bloom's death in
                  "Ithaca," Joyce's final experimental episode "Penelope"
                  becomes a fragmented text of simultaneity (metempsychosis)
                  whereby the consciousness of the transfigured Bloom
                  (transfigured through death) is fused with that of Molly. In
                  other words, a single voice (before gender) comes to represent
                  Bloom and Molly simultaneously, in the closest possible
                  approximation of freedom-a fragmented self predicated upon the
                  commonalities among anxiety, perversions and doubt.},

                  combines adventure and analysis. Haunted by the memory of a
                  moment of lost nerve during a disastrous voyage, Jim submits
                  to condemnation by a Court of Inquiry. In the wake of his
                  disgrace he travels to the exotic region of Patusan, and as
                  the agent at this remote trading post comes to be revered as
                  ‘Tuan Jim.’ Here he finds a measure of serenity and respect
                  within himself. However, when a gang of thieves arrives on the
                  island, the memory of his earlier disgrace comes again to the
                  fore, and his relationship with the people of the island is
                  jeopardized. This new Broadview edition is based on the first
                  British edition of 1900, which provides the historical basis
                  for the accompanying critical and contextual discussions. The
                  appendices include a wide variety of Conrad’s source material,
                  documents concerning the scandal of the Jeddah, along with
                  other materials such as a substantial selection of early

  abstract =     {Scanning books, magazines, and newspapers has become a
                  widespread activity because people believe that much of the
                  worlds information still resides off-line. In general after
                  works are scanned they are indexed for search and processed to
                  add links. This paper describes a new approach to
                  automatically add links by mining popularly quoted passages.
                  Our technique connects elements that are semantically rich, so
                  strong relations are made. Moreover, link targets point within
                  a work, facilitating navigation. This paper makes three
                  contributions. We describe a scalable algorithm for mining
                  repeated word sequences from extremely large text corpora.
                  Second, we present techniques that filter and rank the
                  repeated sequences for quotations. Third, we present a new
                  user interface for navigating across and within works in the
                  collection using quotation links. Our system has been run on a
                  digital library of over 1 million books and has been used by
                  thousands of people.},

  shorttitle =   {At the {{Violet Hour}}},
  abstract =     {At the Violet Hour argues that the literature of the early
                  twentieth-century in England and Ireland was deeply organized
                  around a reckoning with grievous violence, imagined as
                  intimate, direct, and often transformative. The book aims to
                  excavate and amplify a consistent feature of this literature,
                  which is that its central operations (formal as well as
                  thematic) emerge specifically in reference to violence. At the
                  Violet Hour offers a variety of new terms and paradigms for
                  reading violence in literary works, most centrally the
                  concepts it names "enchanted and disenchanted violence." In
                  addition to defining key aspects of literary violence in the
                  period, including the notion of "violet hour," the book
                  explores three major historical episodes: dynamite violence
                  and anarchism in the nineteenth century, which provided a
                  vibrant, new consciousness about explosion, sensationalism,
                  and the limits of political meaning in the act of violence;
                  the turbulent events consuming Ireland in the first thirty
                  years of the century, including the Rising, the War of
                  Independence, and the Civil War, all of which play a vital
                  role in defining the literary corpus; and the 1930s build-up
                  to WWII, including the event that most enthralled Europe in
                  these years, the Spanish Civil War. These historical upheavals
                  provide the imaginative and physical material for a re-reading
                  of four canonical writers (Eliot, Conrad, Yeats, and Woolf),
                  understood not only as including violence in their works, but
                  as generating their primary styles and plots out of its
                  deformations. Included also in this panorama are a host of
                  other works, literary and non-literary, including visual
                  culture, journalism, popular novels, and other modernist

  abstract =     {In its heyday, sentence diagramming was wildly popular in
                  grammar schools across the country. Kitty Burns Florey learned
                  the method in sixth grade from Sister Bernadette: "It was a
                  bit like art, a bit like mathematics. It was a picture of
                  language. I was hooked." Now, in this offbeat history, Florey
                  explores the sentence-diagramming phenomenon, including its
                  humble roots at the Brooklyn Polytechnic, its "balloon
                  diagram" predecessor, and what diagrams of famous writers’
                  sentences reveal about them. Along the way Florey offers up
                  her own commonsense approach to learning and using good
                  grammar. Charming, fun, and instructive, Sister Bernadette’s
                  Barking Dog will be treasured by all kinds of readers, from
                  grumpy grammarians and crossword-puzzle aficionados to
                  students of literature and lovers of language.},

  abstract =     {Reference to Abstract Objects in Discourse presents a novel
                  framework and analysis of the ways we refer to abstract
                  objects in natural language discourse. The book begins with a
                  typology of abstract objects and related entities like
                  eventualities. After an introduction to `bottom up,
                  compositional' discourse representation theory (DRT) and to
                  previous work on abstract objects in DRT (notably work on the
                  semantics of the attitudes), the book turns to a semantic
                  analysis of eventuality and abstract object denoting nominals
                  in English. The book then substantially revises and extends
                  the dynamic semantic framework of DRT to develop an analysis
                  of anaphoric reference to abstract objects and eventualities
                  that exploits discourse structure and the discourse relations
                  that obtain between elements of the structure. A dynamic,
                  semantically based theory of discourse structure (SDRT) is
                  proposed, along with many illustrative examples. Two further
                  chapters then provide the analysis of anaphoric reference to
                  propositions VP ellipsis. The abstract entity anaphoric
                  antecedents are elements of the discourse structures that SDRT
                  develops. The final chapter discusses some logical and
                  philosophical difficulties for a semantic analysis of
                  reference to abstract objects. For semanticists, philosophers
                  of language, computer scientists interested in natural
                  language applications and discourse, philosophical logicians,
                  graduate students in linguistics, philosophy, cognitive

                  The graphics code was roughly one and a half megabytes in
                  size. In the early 1990’s, I redesigned the SYSTAT graphics
                  package using - ject-based technology. I intended to produce a
                  more comprehensive and - namic package. I accomplished this by
                  embedding graphical elements in a tree structure. Rendering
                  graphics was done by walking the tree and editing worked by
                  adding and deleting nodes. The code size fell to under a
                  megabyte. In the late 1990’s, I collaborated with Dan Rope at
                  the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason
                  University to produce a graphics p- duction library called
                  GPL, this time in Java. Our goal was to develop graphics
                  components. This book was nourished by that project. So far,
                  the GPL code size is under half a megabyte.},

                  The question is not simply whether literature thinks, but
                  whether literature thinks theoreticallywhether it has a
                  capacity, without the external aid of analytical methods that
                  have determined Western philosophy and science since the
                  Enlightenment, to theorize the conditions of the world from
                  which it emerges and to which it addresses itself. Suspicion

                  least as old as Plato\&\#39;s notorious expulsion of the poets

                  classical background and in dialogue with a broad range of
                  twentieth-century thinkers, Gourgouris examines a range of

  isbn =         {978-0-8232-5486-6},
  abstract =     {Secular criticism is a term invented by Edward Said to denote
                  not a theory but a practice that counters the tendency of much
                  modern thinking to reach for a transcendentalist comfort zone,
                  the very space philosophy wrested away from religion in the
                  name of modernity. Using this notion as a compass, this book
                  reconfigures recent secularism debates on an entirely
                  different basis, by showing (1) how the secular imagination is
                  closely linked to society's radical poiesis, its capacity to
                  imagine and create unprecedented forms of worldly existence;
                  and (2) how the space of the secular animates the desire for a
                  radical democratic politics that overturns inherited modes of
                  subjugation, whether religious or secularist. Gourgouris's
                  point is to disrupt the co-dependent relation between the
                  religious and the secular hence, his rejection of fashionable
                  languages of postsecularism in order to engage in a double
                  critique of heteronomous politics of all kinds. For him,
                  secular criticism is a form of political being: critical,
                  antifoundational, disobedient, anarchic, yet not negative for
                  negation's sake but creative of new forms of collective
                  reflection, interrogation, and action that alter not only the
                  current terrain of dominant politics but also the very
                  self-conceptualization of what it means to be human. Written
                  in a free and combative style and given both to close readings
                  of texts and to gazing off into the broad horizon, these
                  essays cover a range of issues historical and philosophical,
                  archaic and contemporary, literary and political that
                  ultimately converge in the significance of contemporary
                  radical politics: the assembly movements we have seen in
                  various parts of the world in recent years. The secular
                  imagination demands a radical pedagogy and unlearning a great
                  many established thought patterns. Its most important
                  dimension is not battling religion per se but dismantling
                  theological politics of sovereignty in favor of radical
                  conditions for social autonomy.},

                  investigates the passions that drive us to fall in love with
                  certain sentences over others and the larger implications of
                  our relationship with writing style. At once playful and
                  serious, immersive and analytic, her memoir/critique shows how
                  style elicits particular kinds of moral judgments and
                  subjective preferences, which turn reading into a highly
                  personal and political act.Melding her experiences as reader
                  and critic, Davidson opens new vistas onto works by Jane
                  Austen, Henry James, Marcel Proust, and Thomas Pynchon; adds
                  richer dimension to critiques of W. G. Sebald, Alan
                  Hollinghurst, Thomas Bernhard, and Karl Ove Knausgaard; and

                  Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, Lionel Shriver, George Pelecanos,

                  intimate mechanics that draw us in to literature's sensual
                  frameworks and move us to feel, identify, and relate. Davidson

                  of beauty that heightens his acute sympathy for the
                  inequalities that surround him. Drawn into a secret circle of
                  radical politics he makes a rash vow to commit a violent act
                  of terrorism. But when the Princess Casamassima - beautiful,
                  clever and bored - takes him up and introduces him to her own
                  world of wealth and refinement, Hyacinth is torn. He is
                  horrified by the destruction that would be wreaked by
                  revolution, but still believes he must honour his vow, and
                  finds himself gripped in an agonizing and, ultimately, fatal
                  dilemma. A compelling blend of psychological observation, wit
                  and compassion, The Princess Casamassima (1886) is one of
                  Henry James's most deeply personal novels.},

                  twentieth century, the author claims, a poetry which, growing
                  out of romanticism and symbolism, goes far beyond it. The old
                  generalizations about the nature and use of poetry are no
                  longer applicable, and it is the gradual emergence of new

  abstract =     {In the mid-nineteenth century, the study of English literature
                  began to be divided into courses that surveyed discrete
                  "periods." Since that time, scholars' definitions of
                  literature and their rationales for teaching it have changed
                  radically. But the periodized structure of the curriculum has
                  remained oddly unshaken, as if the exercise of contrasting one
                  literary period with another has an importance that transcends
                  the content of any individual course. Why Literary Periods
                  Mattered explains how historical contrast became central to
                  literary study, and why it remained institutionally central in
                  spite of critical controversy about literature itself.
                  Organizing literary history around contrast rather than causal
                  continuity helped literature departments separate themselves
                  from departments of history. But critics' long reliance on a
                  rhetoric of contrasted movements and fateful turns has
                  produced important blind spots in the discipline. In the
                  twenty-first century, Underwood argues, literary study may
                  need digital technology in particular to develop new methods

                  most people about massive success in the world of fiction, and
                  you’ll typically hear that it’s a game of hazy crystal balls.
                  The sales figures of E. L. James or Dan Brown seem to be
                  freakish—random occurrences in an unknowable market. But what
                  if there were an algorithm that could reveal a secret DNA of
                  bestsellers, regardless of their genre? What if it knew, just
                  from analyzing the words alone, not just why genre writers
                  like John Grisham and Danielle Steel belong on the lists, but
                  also that authors such as Junot Diaz, Jodi Picoult, and Donna
                  Tartt had telltale signs of success all over their pages?
                  Thanks to Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers, the algorithm
                  exists, the code has been cracked, and the results bring fresh
                  new insights into how fiction works and why we read. The
                  Bestseller Code offers a new theory for why Fifty Shades of
                  Grey sold so well. It sheds light on the current craze for
                  dark heroines. It reveals which themes tend to sell best. And
                  all with fascinating supporting data taken from a five-year
                  study of twenty thousand novels. Then there is the hunt for
                  "the one"—the paradigmatic example of bestselling writing
                  according to a computer's analysis of thousands of points of
                  data. The result is surprising, a bit ironic, and delightfully

                  research in accessible terms and offers a new perspective on
                  the New York Times bestseller list. It's a big-idea book about
                  the relationship between creativity and technology that will
                  be provocative to anyone interested in how analytics have
                  already transformed the worlds of finance, medicine, and

                  all the time, what else are they capable of? Stephen Ramsay's
                  intriguing study of computational text analysis examines how
                  computers can be used as "reading machines" to open up
                  entirely new possibilities for literary critics.
                  Computer-based text analysis has been employed for the past
                  several decades as a way of searching, collating, and indexing
                  texts. Despite this, the digital revolution has not penetrated
                  the core activity of literary studies: interpretive analysis
                  of written texts. ~ Computers can handle vast amounts of data,
                  allowing for the comparison of texts in ways that were
                  previously too overwhelming for individuals, but they may also
                  assist in enhancing the entirely necessary role of
                  subjectivity in critical interpretation. Reading Machines
                  discusses the importance of this new form of text analysis
                  conducted with the assistance of computers. Ramsay suggests
                  that the rigidity of computation can be enlisted in the
                  project of intuition, subjectivity, and play.},

                  analysis using computer-assisted interpretive practices. It
                  offers theoretical chapters about text analysis, presents a
                  set of analytical tools (called Voyant) that instantiate the
                  theory, and provides example essays that illustrate the use of
                  these tools. Voyant allows users to integrate interpretation

                  wealthy patron George Herbert, the Fifth Earl of Carnarvon,
                  sensationally opened the tomb of Tutenkhamen. Six weeks later
                  Herbert, the sponsor of the expedition, died in Egypt. The
                  popular press went wild with rumours of a curse on those who
                  disturbed the Pharaoh's rest and for years followed every
                  twist and turn of the fate of the men who had been involved in
                  the historic discovery. Long dismissed by Egyptologists, the
                  mummy's curse remains a part of popular supernatural belief.
                  Roger Luckhurst explores why the myth has captured the British
                  imagination across the centuries, and how it has impacted on
                  popular culture. Tutankhamen was not the first curse story to
                  emerge in British popular culture. This book uncovers the
                  'true' stories of two extraordinary Victorian gentlemen widely
                  believed at the time to have been cursed by the artefacts they
                  brought home from Egypt in the nineteenth century. These are
                  weird and wonderful stories that weave together a cast of
                  famous writers, painters, feted soldiers, lowly smugglers,
                  respected men of science, disreputable society dames, and
                  spooky spiritualists. Focusing on tales of the curse myth,
                  Roger Luckhurst leads us through Victorian museums,
                  international exhibitions, private collections, the
                  battlefields of Egypt and Sudan, and the writings of figures
                  like Arthur Conan Doyle, Rider Haggard and Algernon Blackwood.
                  Written in an open and accessible style, this volume is the
                  product of over ten years research in London's most curious
                  archives. It explores how we became fascinated with Egypt and
                  how this fascination was fuelled by myth, mystery, and rumour.
                  Moreover, it provides a new and startling path through the
                  cultural history of Victorian England and its colonial
                  possessions.},

  isbn =         {978-0-521-81015-9},
  abstract =     {The Victorians were haunted by the supernatural, by ghosts and
                  fairies, table-rappings and telepathic encounters, occult
                  religions and the idea of reincarnation, visions of the other
                  world and a reality beyond the everyday. The Victorian
                  Supernatural explores the sources of these beliefs in their
                  literary, historical and cultural contexts. The collection
                  brings together essays by scholars from literature, history of
                  art and history of science, which examine the diversity of the
                  Victorians' fascination with the supernatural. The essays show
                  that the supernatural was not simply a reaction to a
                  post-Darwinian loss of faith, but was embedded in virtually
                  every aspect of Victorian culture. This important
                  interdisciplinary study sheds light on debates surrounding the
                  relationship between high and popular Victorian culture and
                  contemporary notions of the supernatural.},

                  Doyle's most celebrated Sherlock Holmes adventure. At the end
                  of the yew tree path of his ancestral home, Sir Charles
                  Baskerville is found dead. Close by are the footprints of a
                  gigantic hound. Called to investigate, Holmes seems to face a
                  supernatural foe. In the tense narration of the detective's
                  efforts to solve the crime, Conan Doyle meditates on late
                  Victorian and early twentieth-century ideas of ancestry and
                  atavism, the possible biological determination of criminals,
                  the stability of the British landed classes, and the place of

                  literature. It attacks the widespread presumption that Chaucer
                  invented literary English and argues instead that Chaucer's
                  English is generally traditional. It shows that Chaucer's
                  linguistic innovation was as much performance as fact, but it
                  also traces the linguistic strategies that made (and make) the
                  performance of 'originality' so believable. It also includes a
                  valuable history of every word Chaucer uses. The book also
                  interrogates the theory and methodology of historicising
                  languages, so even as it explores how Chaucer's words matter,
                  it also questions why these particular words have acquired
                  such importance for poets and scholars alike for 600 years.},

It contains much lore of the late classical world beginning with the Seven Liberal Arts, including Rhetoric, and touches on thousands of topics ranging from the names of God, the terminology of the Law, the technologies of fabrics, ships and agriculture to the names of cities and rivers, the theatrical arts, and cooking utensils. Isidore provides etymologies for most of the terms he explains, finding in the causes of words the underlying key to their meaning.

                  computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer
                  to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler
                  ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep.
                  This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.
                  The text offers mathematical and conceptual background,
                  covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability
                  theory and information theory, numerical computation, and
                  machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used
                  by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward
                  networks, regularization, optimization algorithms,
                  convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical
                  methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural
                  language processing, speech recognition, computer vision,
                  online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames.
                  Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such
                  theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders,
                  representation learning, structured probabilistic models,
                  Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate
                  inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be
                  used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in
                  either industry or research, and by software engineers who
                  want to begin using deep learning in their products or
                  platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both
                  readers and instructors.},

  url = {http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1461029/},
  abstract = {The starting point of this dissertation is a methodological question: how can corpus stylistics be used to analyse the syntax of literary fiction? A comparison of the syntax of Henry James’s late style in The Golden Bowl (1904) and his early style in Washington Square (1881) was used as a case study. While James’s late style is very widely discussed by literary critics and often seen as ‘difficult’, there has been very little evidence offered to substantiate this description. Within the extensive field of Henry James studies, there have been few linguistic descriptions of James’s prose. To remedy this, I compiled The Henry James Parsed Corpus (HJPC) from five chapters from each of the two novels. My analysis of the corpus showed that The Golden Bowl is more syntactically complex than Washington Square in a number of ways but only in sentences which do not contain direct speech. James’s idiosyncratic use of parenthesis was defined precisely using syntactic criteria and named delay. The Golden Bowl has more delay than Washington Square but also only in non-speech sentences. Only a small number of sentences have very high numbers of dependent clauses and/or delay. I argue that these exceptional sentences create the impression that the later text is homogeneously difficult. My research shows that this impression is deceptive; in fact the overwhelming majority of sentences in The Golden Bowl are no more syntactically complex than those of Washington Square. A secondary use of the HJPC is to assist close reading. Chapter outlines of the central chapter of each novel were generated and were found to mirror plot developments and dialogue sections. Salient sentences highlighted many key moments in the plot, or revealed aspects of characters’ personalities.},

                  language instruction is examined in this volume. The first
                  problem surveyed, the extent to which a study of Latin can
                  help students master English, yields the conclusion that any
                  benefit from the study of Latin transferable to English is
                  likely to be meager and superficial. An analysis of the
                  difficulties in learning to spell, the second subject, leads
                  to the conclusions that (1) teaching rules, "hard spots," and
                  syllabication are of little value, but (2) individualizing
                  instruction, using test-study methods (as opposed to
                  study-test methods), and increasing motivation are helpful. An
                  examination of the value of traditional grammar, linguisitcs,
                  and writing exercises for increasing writing skills yields the
                  following conclusions: (1) Instruction in formal grammar and a
                  greater number of writing assignments apparently effects
                  little improvement in writing skills. (2) A final judgment on
                  the value of linguistics and on methods of measuring writing
                  improvement cannot be made at this time because of inadequate
                  research information. Sentence diagraming, the fourth subject
                  discussed, is found to be an inefficient and generally
                  inferior method of instruction. A bibliography on the problems
                  is appended. (LH)},

  shorttitle = {The Fabrication Text in Modernism},
  abstract = {This dissertation examines the relation of word and image in late modernism through the literary form of the “fabrication text.” The fabrication text is an author's description of how a particular work was or could be made. Presented as documentary supplements to actual or prospective works, such texts are not always factual or even plausible. Still, whether factual or fictional, I argue, their claims constitute integral parts of the composition of the works and should be read as such. Between the 1920s and 1960s modernism's interest in demonstrating the shape and intensity of the work of making works found a flexible resource in the fabrication text. At the same time, modernists used these supplements to change the structure of an existing work in unanticipated ways. Fabrication texts thus allowed modernists to reconfigure the history of their earlier works or the relation of those works to specific institutions and traditions of production.
Modernism in both literature and the visual arts is characterized by opposing procedures of purification and hybridization. My study looks at exemplary descriptions of these procedures in late-modernist fabrication texts, focusing on Stein, Duchamp, and Borges. My first chapter reconstructs Borges's critique of formal purism, abstraction, and extravagance in “Pierre Menard.” In chapter two, I follow Stein's project to isolate the ontological difference between sentences and paragraphs and to construct a new kind of “self-diagraming”sentence. I connect Stein's project of “saving the sentence” to her analysis of painting in Lectures in America and argue that her new sentences inhabit a zone between not only old sentences and paragraphs but old sentences and pictures. Chapter three pursues a systematic analysis of Duchamp's notes on the “infra-thin.” I contend that Duchamp's View magazine covers reconfigure the conjunction between his Large Glass and Green Box in terms of the infra-thin. Together Glass and Box unfold an “inhuman” literary dimension of painting between modernist visual abstraction and an anthropomorphic literature. Examining these modernist fabrication texts reveals that what appear to be projects of either separating or mixing aesthetic categories are in fact precise cartographies of the regions, entities, and events between these categories.},

Institutions of higher education have not implemented the Reed \& Kellogg System to bring concrete and abstract together to meet the needs and to match the learning styles of a wide variety of adult learners to the end goal of improving their writing skills. Three ENG 101/111 Fundamentals of Composition classes that met 5 days a week at Northland International University (est. 1976) were the setting for this experiment. The freshmen for the fall 2011 were block registered, randomly placed into each class, by the Registrar's Office via an online registration program. For 5 weeks of the semester, Weeks 4 through 8 of a 15-week semester, the students in the only three English classes that met 5 days a week utilized the exact same syllabus for ENG 101/111 Fundamentals of Composition; however, one class of the three received the intervention of the Reed \& Kellogg System. At the end of the 5-week experiment, a posttest was administered to analyze the differences between the mean scores of the three classes. Following the experiment, a seminar with the same treatment was conducted for the control group. The results of the experiment indicated that there was no significant difference in the experimental group (n = 24) as compared to the control group (n = 22). The control group scored slightly better in posttest results.},

                  the nature of the mental representation and processes
                  underlying spatial reasoning with diagrams and sentences. The
                  second is to investigate whether mental representations
                  reproduce geometrical relations relative to spatial reference
                  frames. Forty participants solved 64 spatial reasoning
                  problems that were displayed using diagrams or sentences.
                  Problems varied with respect to their logical structure and
                  geometrical content. We measured the premise's inspection
                  times, the responses, and the response times. Problems were
                  significantly (p {$<$} .01) easier to represent and solve when
                  displayed as diagrams than as sentences, indicating that
                  participants constructed mental models. Mental representations
                  and spatial deductions also varied consistently with the
                  geometrical content, suggesting that mental models reproduced
                  this content relative to a viewer-centred reference frame.
                  Cette étude avait deux objectifs principaux: (1) déterminer la
                  nature de la représentation mentale et des processus
                  sousjacents au raisonnement spatial avec des phrases et des
                  diagrammes; et (2) l'usage de références spatiales lors du
                  raisonnement spatial. Quarante adultes ont résolu 64 problèmes
                  de raisonnement spatial présentés à l'aide de phrases ou de
                  diagrammes. Ces problèmes variaient suivant leur structure
                  logique et leur contenu géométrique. Nous avons mesuré le
                  temps d'inspection de chaque prémisse, les réponses, et les
                  temps de réponses. Les problèmes étaient significativement (p
                  {$<$} .01) plus faciles à résoudre lorsque présentés sous
                  forme de diagrammes que de phrases; indiquant que les sujets
                  construisaient des modèles mentaux. L'effet du contenu
                  géométrique suggère que les modèles mentaux reproduisent ce
                  contenu relativement àun système de références spatiales.},

                  interested in contemporary English, especially those whose
                  primary area of interest is English as a second language,
                  primary or secondary-school education, English stylistics,
                  theoretical and applied linguistics, or speech pathology. The
                  emphasis is on empirical facts of English rather than any
                  particular theory of linguistics; the text does not assume any
                  background in language or linguistics. In this newly revised
                  edition numerous example sentences are taken from the Corpus
                  of Contemporary American English. A full glossary of key
                  terms, an additional chapter on pedagogy and new sections on
                  cognitive semantics and politeness have been added. Other
                  changes include: completely updated print references; web
                  links to sites of special interest and relevance; and a
                  revised, reader-friendly layout. A companion website that
                  includes a complete workbook with self-testing exercises and a
                  comprehensive list of web links accompanies the book. The

                  of the context and function of use upon the structure of the

                  a valuable and interesting collection of Stein's

                  more informative than the usual 'selected works.' Out of the
                  immense opus that Stein produced over a long and prolific
                  career, Joan Retallack has chosen telling pieces, so as to
                  show both the extraordinary thematic, generic, and stylistic
                  variety, and the coherence of her life's work. Meanwhile,
                  Retallack's delightful and informative introduction can stand
                  on its own as a luminous contribution to our understanding of
                  Gertrude Stein's work and her place in literary history. The
                  fascinating documents that end the book can be regarded as the
                  sweet at the end of a fully satisfying and memorable
                  experience. This is an essential book for both new and

                  to our knowledge of Stein, revelatory of such issues as racism
                  while viewing Stein's presence on the page and in the ear as
                  performative play that creates a sensual apprehension of a new
                  time (a perception of the activity of happiness). The

  abstract = {As the field of composition studies became more sophisticated in its understanding of research, the designs and assumptions underlying the early work were called into question. Researchers were challenged to design studies that were sensitive to the varying contexts in which writers write and to the ways their own roles shaped their investigations. The more comprehensive studies called for by these critiques are only now beginning to appear. This volume presents some articles in which writers and what they do are at the center of inquiry. The focus is on what actually occurs as people write and how they make sense of what they are doing. Choosing such a focus grants human action central importance and enacts the belief that looking closely at individuals can be a primary starting point for understanding them and their worlds. Other papers take the researcher's shaping role into account. The integrity of such work rests not so much on a lifeless detachment from the phenomena being studied as on the author's vital engagement, and on a faithful rendering of what has been observed. This includes the author revealing his or her own impact of what has been seen and said. In the broadest sense, composing is something we all do: the students and parents and writers and teachers who serve as subjects of research and those who write the research itself. It is what each of us is engaged in when we shape our understanding of life through the writing we do. And it is what can continue to light the way in composition studies for it illuminates what still makes this inquiry so intriguing and so rich -- that only human beings have this capacity to look and see more, to create new texts and new work, and in the creating compose their way to new understandings and new selves.},

                  of a simple diagram accompanied by two sentences and were
                  asked to select the sentence that best expressed the meaning
                  of the diagram. Each diagram showed a relationship between two
                  concepts. The relationships were category membership,
                  possession of a property, and causality. The relative
                  placement of the concepts was varied. In the first experiment,
                  the concepts were given nonsense names. Significant biases in
                  response frequencies were found, suggesting that, in the
                  absence of semantic content, the interpretation of the
                  diagrams was largely determined by syntactic rules of English.
                  In the second experiment, similar biases were found for
                  diagrams whose concepts were given English names. However, the
                  biases were less evident when the diagrams violated the rules
                  of English syntax. This suggested that conflict between the
                  sense of English and a diagram's spatial arrangement makes
                  consistent interpretation unlikely. Conclusions are drawn
                  concerning the relationships between the spatial arrangement
                  of diagrams and the meaning of relationships among concepts
                  stated in sentences. Suggestions for diagram design are

                  (LB) sentences are more difficult to process than
                  right-branching (RB) sentences. In this study, the hypothesis
                  was tested that LB sentences are judged to be more formal than
                  RB ones and that center-branching (CB) sentences would behave
                  like LB ones. Three groups of subjects, university students in
                  England, Wales, and the United States, ordered three versions
                  of 18 sentences in terms of their formality. LB and CB
                  sentences were considered more formal than RB ones by all
                  three groups of students. LB and CB types did not differ from
                  each other. In a second study, American students choose from
                  the group of three sentences the one they would say to a
                  formal listener (professor/employer) or to an informal
                  listener (brother/sister or close friend). RB sentences were
                  attributed to informal listeners and LB and CB sentences, to
                  formal listeners.},

                  sentence-combining—and attempts to discern why these three
                  pedagogies have been so completely elided within contemporary
                  composition studies. The usefulness of these sentence-based
                  rhetorics was never disproved, but a growing wave of
                  anti-formalism, anti-behaviorism, and anti-empiricism within
                  English-based composition studies after 1980 doomed them to a
                  marginality under which they still exist today. The result of
                  this erasure of sentence pedagogies is a culture of writing
                  instruction that has very little to do with or to say about
                  the sentence outside of a purely grammatical discourse.},

                  Power speaks to everyone who has wrestled with words while
                  seeking to gain power with them. Here, Peter Elbow emphasizes
                  that the essential activities underlying good writing and the
                  essential exercises promoting it are really not difficult at
                  all. Employing a cookbook approach, Elbow provides the reader
                  (and writer) with various recipes: for getting words down on
                  paper, for revising, for dealing with an audience, for getting
                  feedback on a piece of writing, and still other recipes for
                  approaching the mystery of power in writing. In a new
                  introduction, he offers his reflections on the original
                  edition, discusses the responses from people who have followed
                  his techniques, how his methods may differ from other
                  processes, and how his original topics are still pertinent to
                  today's writer. By taking risks and embracing mistakes, Elbow
                  hopes the writer may somehow find a hold on the creative
                  process and be able to heighten two mentalities--the
                  production of writing and the revision of it. From students
                  and teachers to novelists and poets, Writing with Power
                  reminds us that we can celebrate the uses of mystery, chaos,
                  nonplanning, and magic, while achieving analysis, conscious
                  control, explicitness, and care in whatever it is we set down

                  AS A TEACHING DEVICE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE
                  SENT TO THE STATE ENGLISH CURRICULUM DIRECTORS OR THE STATE
                  SUPERINTENDENTS OF EDUCATION IN ALL 50 STATES, AND THE CITY
                  SUPERVISORS OF ENGLISH IN THE 15 LARGEST AMERICAN CITIES. IN
                  ADDITION, PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE WAS CARRIED OUT WITH
                  EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS. RESPONSES TO THE
                  QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RECEIVED FROM 94 PERCENT OF THE STATES AND
                  67 PERCENT OF THE CITIES. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE REED AND
                  KELLOGG DIAGRAM WAS USED BY A MAJORITY OF THE STATES (MOST
                  COMMONLY ON THE JUNIOR HGIH SCHOOL LEVEL) AND BY A MINORITY OF
                  THE CITIES (ON BOTH THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY LEVELS).
                  LINGUISTIC DIAGRAMS WERE SELDOM USED, THOUGH INTEREST IN THEM
                  WAS INCREASING. NO INSTANCE OF THE USE OF THE BALLOON OR
                  SLOT-AND-FILLER DIAGRAMS WAS FOUND. THREE-QUARTERS OF THE
                  RESPONDING STATE DEPARTMENTS AND NEARLY ALL OF THE CITIES HAD
                  NO MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR TEACHERS ON DIAGRAMING, AND
                  TWO-THIRDS OF THE RESPONDING CITY SUPERVISORS DESIRED THAT
                  MATERIALS ON DIAGRAMS BE PROVIDED THROUGH A CENTRAL AGENT.
                  ALTHOUGH RELEVANT RESEARCH ON DIAGRAMS INDICATES THAT THEY ARE
                  NOT EFFECTIVE TEACHING DEVICES FOR IMPROVING COMMUNICATION
                  SKILLS, MANY WRITERS ON ENGLISH EDUCATION ADVOCATE THEIR USE
                  FOR THIS PURPOSE OR FOR GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS. (THIS REPORT WAS

                  professional writing. Recent criticisms of contrastive

                  Our model is a simple feed-forward neural network that

                  literature, namely, nineteenth-century British novels and
                  serials. We derive the networks from dialogue interactions,
                  and thus our method depends on the ability to determine when
                  two characters are in conversation. Our approach involves
                  character name chunking, quoted speech attribution and
                  conversation detection given the set of quotes. We extract
                  features from the social networks and examine their
                  correlation with one another, as well as with metadata such as
                  the novel's setting. Our results provide evidence that the
                  majority of novels in this time period do not fit two
                  characterizations provided by literacy scholars. Instead, our
                  results suggest an alternative explanation for differences in

                  discussion the reader is offered a definition, a text for
                  analysis, exercises and tasks, in addition to a suggested
                  solution. Stylistics: A Practical Coursebook is genuinely
                  `student friendly' and will be an invaluable tool for all
                  beginning undergraduates and A-level students of language and
                  literature.},

                  British and American writers, from a variety of different
                  periods, the contributors show how discourse stylistics can
                  provide models for the systematic description of, for example,
                  dialogue in fiction; language of drama and balladic poetry;

                  twentieth-century writers such as Joyce, Auden, Pinter and

                  representation of criminals and their offences but instead
                  construct them in accordance with societal discourse
                  surrounding this issue. This book takes an interdisciplinary
                  approach at the intersection of Linguistics, Criminology, and
                  Media Studies and demonstrates how Linguistics can contribute
                  to the study of crime in the media. By combining the tools
                  offered by Corpus Linguistics and Critical Stylistics (a
                  text-based framework for Critical Discourse Analysis),
                  evidence is provided for predominant perceptions of crime and

                  crimes in two newspaper corpora compiled from the German and

  abstract =     {This article reports on a corpus stylistic study of the
                  language of soliloquies in Shakespeare’s plays. Literary
                  corpus stylistics can use corpus linguistic methods to test
                  claims made by literary critics and identify hitherto
                  unnoticed features. Existing literary studies of soliloquies
                  tend to define and classify them, to trace the history of the
                  form or to offer literary appreciation; yet they pay
                  surprisingly little attention to the language which
                  characterises soliloquies. By creating a soliloquy corpus and
                  a dialogue corpus from 37 Shakespeare plays, and comparing the
                  former against the latter using WordSmith Tools, I identify
                  key language forms in soliloquies. Using an analytical
                  framework broadly based on Halliday’s ideational,
                  interpersonal and textual metafunctions of language, I
                  interpret my results and relate them, where possible, to
                  literary critical interpretations. I also compare comedy,
                  history and tragedy soliloquy corpora. My main findings show
                  the following linguistic features to be characteristic of
                  soliloquies in general: words relating to mental states and
                  the body; pragmatic noise; linking adverbials and first-person
                  pronouns. Characteristic forms in comedy, history and tragedy
                  emphasise love, the monarch and the supernatural respectively.
                  The empirical evidence presented here shows that Shakespeare
                  regularly exploited certain language forms in soliloquies to
                  represent expressions of doubt, resolve, introspection and
                  strong emotion, among others. These forms not only add depth
                  to characterisation, aid plot development and provide
                  performance cues for actors, but may also conform to certain
                  audience expectations.},

                  literary texts it studies and the texts and collections of
                  texts with which they are compared. It focuses on style,
                  diction, characterization, and interpretation of single works
                  and across larger groups of texts, using both huge natural
                  language corpora and smaller, more specialized collections of
                  texts created for specific tasks, and applies statistical
                  techniques used in the narrower confines of authorship

  abstract =     {This book presents an innovative approach to the language of
                  one of the most popular English authors. It illustrates how
                  corpus linguistic methods can be employed to study electronic
                  versions of texts by Charles Dickens. With particular focus on
                  Dickens's novels, the book proposes a way into the Dickensian
                  world that starts from linguistic patterns. The analysis
                  begins with clusters, i.e. repeated sequences of words, as
                  pointers to local textual functions. Combining quantitative
                  findings with qualitative analyses, the book takes a fresh
                  view on Dickens's techniques of characterisation, the literary
                  presentation of body language and speech in fiction. The
                  approach brings together corpus linguistics, literary
                  stylistics and Dickens criticism. It thus contributes to
                  bridging the gap between linguistic and literary studies and
                  will be a useful resource for both researchers and students of

                  Written specifically for students studying this topic for the
                  first time, the book begins with a discussion of the
                  underlying principles of electronic text analysis. It then
                  examines how these corpora enhance our understanding of
                  literary and non-literary works. In the first section the
                  author introduces the concepts of concordance and lexical
                  frequency, concepts which~are then applied to a range of areas
                  of language study. Key areas examined are the use of on-line
                  corpora to complement traditional stylistic analysis, and the
                  ways in which methods such as concordance and frequency counts
                  can reveal a particular ideology within a text. Presenting an
                  accessible and thorough understanding of the underlying
                  principles of electronic text analysis, the book contains
                  abundant illustrative examples and a glossary with definitions

                  example of language in use; no systematic apparatus can claim
                  to describe language if it does not embrace the literature
                  also”. Corpus linguistics stresses the importance of data as
                  evidence of language use. The study of literary texts,
                  however, has not received much attention yet within corpus
                  linguistics, not least because it seems that for the corpus
                  methodology, literature presents a difficult task. Although
                  creativity and literariness can be described against the
                  background of norms of language, the features that are crucial
                  for one specific text are not always straightforward to
                  identify and describe. The present paper looks at the example
                  of Ian Fleming’s novel Casino Royale and explores corpus
                  stylistic approaches to the study of this text. We will look
                  at issues that are raised by frequency information for a
                  single novel, and we will discuss routes for analysis that are
                  suggested by computer key words and the comparison of one
                  novel with a general purpose corpus such as the BNC and more
                  specific collections of prose fiction. The paper is not only
                  interested in the description of a particular novel, but also
                  aims to discuss general theoretical questions. It will be
                  argued that local categories of description are crucial to
                  capture textual features in literary texts, and – at the same
                  time – have to play a part in the systematic apparatus that
                  corpus linguistics suggests to describe language.},

                  bodies of text, corpus linguistics demonstrates and supports
                  linguistic statements and assumptions. In recent years it has
                  seen an ever-widening application in a variety of fields:
                  computational linguistics, discourse analysis, forensic
                  linguistics, pragmatics and translation studies. Bringing
                  together experts in the key areas of development and change,
                  the handbook is structured around six themes which take the
                  reader through building and designing a corpus to using a
                  corpus to study literature and translation.~ A comprehensive

  abstract =     {For the past forty years, linguistics has been dominated by
                  the idea that language is categorical and linguistic
                  competence discrete. It has become increasingly clear,
                  however, that many levels of representation, from phonemes to
                  sentence structure, show probabilistic properties, as does the
                  language faculty. Probabilistic linguistics conceptualizes
                  categories as distributions and views knowledge of language
                  not as a minimal set of categorical constraints but as a set
                  of gradient rules that may be characterized by a statistical
                  distribution. Whereas categorical approaches focus on the
                  endpoints of distributions of linguistic phenomena,
                  probabilistic approaches focus on the gradient middle ground.
                  Probabilistic linguistics integrates all the progress made by
                  linguistics thus far with a probabilistic perspective.This
                  book presents a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic
                  approaches to linguistic inquiry. It covers the application of
                  probabilistic techniques to phonology, morphology, semantics,
                  syntax, language acquisition, psycholinguistics, historical
                  linguistics, and sociolinguistics. It also includes a tutorial

                  of competing approaches. By showing their current and

                  linguists and others can judge what are the most useful models

                  Statistics for Linguistics with R. The volume is an
                  introduction to statistics for linguists using the open source
                  software R. It is aimed at students and instructors/professors
                  with little or no statistical background and is written in a
                  non-technical and reader-friendly/accessible style. It first
                  introduces in detail the overall logic underlying quantitative
                  studies: exploration, hypothesis formulation and
                  operationalization, and the notion and meaning of significance
                  tests. It then introduces some basics of the software R
                  relevant to statistical data analysis. A chapter on
                  descriptive statistics explains how summary statistics for
                  frequencies, averages, and correlations are generated with R
                  and how they are graphically represented best. A chapter on
                  analytical statistics explains how statistical tests are
                  performed in R on the basis of many different linguistic case
                  studies: For nearly every single example, it is explained what
                  the structure of the test looks like, how hypotheses are
                  formulated, explored, and tested for statistical significance,
                  how the results are graphically represented, and how one would
                  summarize them in a paper/article. A chapter on selected
                  multifactorial methods introduces how more complex research
                  designs can be studied: methods for the study of
                  multifactorial frequency data, correlations, tests for means,
                  and binary response data are discussed and exemplified
                  step-by-step. Also, the exploratory approach of hierarchical
                  cluster analysis is illustrated in detail. The book comes with
                  many exercises, boxes with short think breaks and warnings,
                  recommendations for further study, and answer keys as well as
                  a statistics for linguists newsgroup on the companion website.
                  Just like the first edition, it is aimed at students, faculty,
                  and researchers with little or no statistical background in
                  statistics or the open source programming language R. It
                  avoids mathematical jargon and discusses the logic and
                  structure of quantitative studies and introduces descriptive
                  statistics as well as a range of monofactorial statistical
                  tests for frequencies, distributions, means, dispersions, and
                  correlations. The comprehensive revision includes new small
                  sections on programming topics that facilitate statistical
                  analysis, the addition of a variety of statistical functions
                  readers can apply to their own data, a revision of overview
                  sections on statistical tests and regression modeling, a
                  complete rewrite of the chapter on multifactorial approaches,
                  which now contains sections on linear regression, binary and
                  ordinal logistic regression, multinomial and Poisson
                  regression, and repeated-measures ANOVA, and a new visual tool
                  to identify the right statistical test for a given problem and
                  data set. The amount of code available from the companion
                  website has doubled in size, providing much supplementary
                  material on statistical tests and advanced plotting.},

  abstract =     {Stanley Fish is one of America's most stimulating literary
                  theorists. In this book, he undertakes a profound
                  reexamination of some of criticism's most basic assumptions.
                  He penetrates to the core of the modern debate about
                  interpretation, explodes numerous misleading formulations, and
                  offers a stunning proposal for a new way of thinking about the
                  way we read. Fish begins by examining the relation between a
                  reader and a text, arguing against the formalist belief that
                  the text alone is the basic, knowable, neutral, and unchanging
                  component of literary experience. But in arguing for the right
                  of the reader to interpret and in effect create the literary
                  work, he skillfully avoids the old trap of subjectivity. To
                  claim that each reader essentially participates in the making
                  of a poem or novel is not, he shows, an invitation to
                  unchecked subjectivity and to the endless proliferation of
                  competing interpretations. For each reader approaches a
                  literary work not as an isolated individual but as part of a
                  community of readers. 'Indeed," he writes, "it is interpretive
                  communities, rather than either the text or reader, that
                  produce meanings." The book is developmental, not static. Fish
                  at all times reveals the evolutionary aspect of his work--the
                  manner in which he has assumed new positions, altered them,
                  and then moved on. Previously published essays are introduced
                  by headnotes which relate them to the central notion of
                  interpretive communities as it emerges in the final chapters.
                  In the course of refining his theory, Fish includes rather
                  than excludes the thinking of other critics and shows how
                  often they agree with him, even when he and they may appear to
                  be most dramatically at odds. Engaging, lucid, provocative,
                  this book will immediately find its place among the seminal
                  works of modern literary criticism.},

                  from questions of attribution. Yet these questions remain
                  urgent and important for any historical study of writing, and
                  have been given a powerful new impetus by advances in
                  statistical studies of language and the coming on line of
                  large databases of texts in machine-searchable form. The
                  present book is the first comprehensive survey of the field
                  from a literary perspective to appear for forty years. It
                  covers both traditional and computer based approaches to
                  attribution, and evaluates each in respect of their
                  potentialities and limitations. It revisits a number of famous
                  controversies, including those concerning the authorship of
                  the Homeric poems, books from the Old and New Testaments, and
                  the plays of Shakespeare. Written with wit as well as

  abstract =     {Style is a fundamental and ubiquitous aspect of the human
                  experience: Everyone instantly and constantly assesses people
                  and things according to their individual styles, academics
                  establish careers by researching musical, artistic, or
                  architectural styles, and entire industries maintain
                  themselves by continuously creating and marketing new styles.
                  Yet what exactly style is and how it works are elusive: We
                  certainly know it when we see it, but there is no shared and
                  clear understanding of the diverse phenomena that we call
                  style. The Structure of Style explores this issue from a
                  computational viewpoint, in terms of how information is
                  represented, organized, and transformed in the production and
                  perception of different styles. New computational techniques
                  are now making it possible to model the role of style in the
                  creation of and response to human artifacts—and therefore to
                  develop software systems that directly make use of style in
                  useful ways. Argamon, Burns, and Dubnov organize the research
                  they have collected in this book according to the three roles
                  that computation can play in stylistics. The first section of
                  the book, Production, provides conceptual foundations by
                  describing computer systems that create artifacts—musical
                  pieces, texts, artworks—in different styles. The second
                  section, Perception, explains methods for analyzing different
                  styles and gleaning useful information, viewing style as a
                  form of communication. The final section, Interaction, deals
                  with reciprocal interaction between style producers and
                  perceivers, in areas such as interactive media, improvised
                  musical accompaniment, and game playing. The Structure of
                  Style is written for researchers and practitioners in areas
                  including information retrieval, computer art and music,
                  digital humanities, computational linguistics, and artificial
                  intelligence, who can all benefit from this comprehensive

                  extend their methodological tool kit to include quantitative
                  and computational approaches to the study of text. Computation
                  provides access to information in text that we simply cannot
                  gather using traditional qualitative methods of close reading
                  and human synthesis. Text Analysis with R for Students of
                  Literature provides a practical introduction to computational
                  text analysis using the open source programming language R. R
                  is extremely popular throughout the sciences and because of
                  its accessibility, R is now used increasingly in other
                  research areas. Readers begin working with text right away and
                  each chapter works through a new technique or process such
                  that readers gain a broad exposure to core R procedures and a
                  basic understanding of the possibilities of computational text
                  analysis at both the micro and macro scale. Each chapter
                  builds on the previous as readers move from small scale
                  “microanalysis” of single texts to large scale “macroanalysis”
                  of text corpora, and each chapter concludes with a set of
                  practice exercises that reinforce and expand upon the chapter
                  lessons. The book’s focus is on making the technical palatable
                  and making the technical useful and immediately gratifying.},

                  through the most salient theoretical, interpretive, and

                  literary forms such as e-books, digital archives, and
                  electronic literature. While Digital Humanities (DH) has been
                  hailed as the 'next big thing' in literary studies, many
                  students and scholars remain perplexed as to what a DH
                  approach to literature entails, and skeptical observers
                  continue to see literature and the digital world as
                  fundamentally incompatible. In its argument that digital and
                  traditional scholarship should be placed in dialogue with each
                  other, this book contextualizes the advent of the digital in
                  literary theory, explores the new questions readers can ask of
                  texts when they become digitized, and investigates the
                  challenges that fresh forms of born-digital fiction pose to

                  scholars should stop reading books and start counting,
                  graphing, and mapping them instead. He insists that such a
                  move could bring new luster to a tired field, one that in some
                  respects is among .the most backwards disciplines in the
                  academy.. Literary study, he argues, has been random and
                  unsystematic. For any given period scholars focus on a select
                  group of a mere few hundred texts: the canon. As a result,
                  they have allowed a narrow distorting slice of history to pass
                  for the total picture. Moretti offers bar charts, maps, and
                  time lines instead, developing the idea of .distant reading,.
                  set forth in his path-breaking essay .Conjectures on World
                  Literature,. into a full-blown experiment in literary
                  historiography, where the canon disappears into the larger
                  literary system. Charting entire genres.the epistolary, the
                  gothic, and the historical novel.as well as the literary

                  entity recognition using R In Detail Text Mining (or text data
                  mining or text analytics) is the process of extracting useful
                  and high-quality information from text by devising patterns
                  and trends. R provides an extensive ecosystem to mine text
                  through its many frameworks and packages. Starting with basic
                  information about the statistics concepts used in text mining,
                  this book will teach you how to access, cleanse, and process
                  text using the R language and will equip you with the tools

                  statistically analyze results. In addition to providing an
                  in-depth examination of core text mining and link detection
                  tools, methods and operations, the book examines advanced
                  preprocessing techniques, knowledge representation

                  book explores current real-world, mission-critical

                  unimaginably vast amount of digital information which is
                  getting ever vaster ever more rapidly. This makes it possible
                  to do many things that previously could not be done: spot
                  business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on.
                  Managed well, the textual data can be used to unlock new
                  sources of economic value, provide fresh insights into science
                  and hold governments to account. As the Internet expands and
                  our natural capacity to process the unstructured text that it
                  contains diminishes, the value of text mining for information
                  retrieval and search will increase dramatically. Extensive
                  case studies, most in a tutorial format, allow the reader to

                  speech which make up at least a third of fictional works in
                  English--do not really exist. But far from being a largely
                  inert linguistic mass which has a simple but uninteresting
                  function, these words and their frequency of use can tell us a
                  great deal about the characters who speak them. In Computation
                  into Criticism, he reveals that even in so early a novel as
                  Northanger Abbey the major characters differ very sharply in
                  the frequency with which each uses such words as "the," "of,"
                  "it," and "I." When, especially in the later novels, there is
                  evidence of consistent and meaningful change in even the
                  simplest idioms of the heroines, it becomes possible to study
                  character development in an even clearer light than before.
                  What emerges from this fascinating study is not a game with

                  Components Analyses of the frequencies of very common words in
                  the dialogue of characters in plays by Ben Jonson. The first
                  Principal Component in the data, the most important axis of
                  differentiation, proves in each case to be a spectrum from
                  elaborate, authoritative pronouncements to a dialogue style of
                  reaction and interchange. Reference to other quantitative
                  studies, literary and otherwise, suggests that a version of
                  this axis may often be among the most important in stylistic
                  difference generally. In Jonson it has a chronological aspect
                  -- there is a shift over his career from one end to the other
                  -- and there is often significant change within the idiolects
                  of his characters as well. Successive segments of Volpone and
                  Mosca's parts (they are protagonist and antagonist of Volpone,
                  perhaps Jonson's best-known comedy) change markedly along this
                  axis, beginning far apart but coming by the end of the play to
                  resemble each other very closely on this measure.},

                  was influential in the development of modern statistics.
                  Originally published in 1944, this book was formed from Yule's
                  interest in the controversy surrounding the authorship of De
                  Imitatione Christi, a text generally attributed to Thomas ...
                  Kempis. The text presents a statistical analysis of the
                  vocabulary used in De Imitatione Christi, comparing it to
                  different works written by Thomas and works by other authors.
                  In so doing, it moves into the broader territory of purely
                  statistical questions regarding frequency distributions and
                  sample sizes. This book will be of value to anyone with an

                  and discusses a number of aspects of the concept described by
                  the term. It is pointed out that although many writers use it
                  to refer to the implied attitudinal meaning of a word,
                  Sinclair uses the term to refer to the discourse function of a
                  unit of meaning. Problems of apparent counter-examples, when a
                  word or unit does not have the semantic prosody that is
                  typical of it, are discussed. The second point made is that
                  the phenomena described as ‘semantic prosody’ can be regarded
                  as observational data, but that they are often used to explain
                  subjective reactions to a given text or to predict such
                  reactions. The issues raised by these different uses are
                  discussed. Finally, the pitfalls of using concordance lines to
                  observe attitudinal language in highly opinionated texts are
                  discussed.},

  abstract =     {This study has a two-fold objective: 1) to examine the density
                  and variety of parallelism in Virginia Woolf's landmark novel
                  To the Lighthouse through a sample-based comparison between
                  this novel and other representative modernist novels; 2) to
                  discuss the specific lexical and syntactic structures that
                  characterize Woolf's parallelism. The results are extracted
                  from a corpus-assisted reading and sampled textual analysis of
                  her work. It shows that Woolfian parallelism is defined by an
                  abundance of antithetical and synonymous lexical bundles,
                  juxtaposed propositional phrases, -ing participles and
                  appositional structures. Those structures constitute her
                  special sentential development which is marked by the rhetoric
                  of opposition, the rhetoric of simultaneity and progression,
                  and the rhetoric of specificity. It is concluded that in To
                  the Lighthouse, Woolf manipulates the above-mentioned
                  linguistic resources to strike an artistic balance between
                  poetry and prose, order and chaos, the physical reality and
                  the mental world, and finally achieves what she calls "a
                  feminine sentence". [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

                  useful contributions to the descriptive inventory of literary
                  stylistics. The concept of local textual functions is employed
                  as a descriptive tool for the stylistic analysis of a corpus
                  of texts by Charles Dickens. It is suggested that clusters,
                  i.e. repeated sequences of words, can be interpreted as
                  pointers to local textual functions. The focus is on five-word
                  clusters and five functional groups are identified: Labels,
                  Speech clusters, As If clusters, Body Part clusters and Time
                  and Place clusters. The analysis draws on the identification
                  of key clusters comparing the Dickens corpus with a corpus of
                  nineteenth-century fiction, it identifies links to literary
                  criticism and it gives specific attention to the group of Body
                  Part clusters to illustrate the functional variation of
                  clusters.},

                  Wmatrix software developed by UCREL at Lancaster University.
                  The quantitative analysis is supplemented by a qualitative
                  analysis into recurring patterns of metaphor. The author
                  concludes that these analyses successfully differentiate all
                  six characters, both synchronically and diachronically, and
                  claims that this methodology is also applicable to the study
                  of personality in non-literary language. The book, written in
                  a clear and accessible style, will be of interest to
                  post-graduate students and academics in linguistics,
                  stylistics, literary studies, psychology and also
                  computational approaches.},

                  from questions of attribution. Yet these questions remain
                  urgent and important for any historical study of writing, and
                  have been given a powerful new impetus by advances in
                  statistical studies of language and the coming on line of

                  present book is the first comprehensive survey of the field
                  from a literary perspective to appear for forty years. It
                  covers both traditional and computer based approaches to
                  attribution, and evaluates each in respect of their
                  potentialities and limitations. It revisits a number of famous
                  controversies, including those concerning the authorship of
                  the Homeric poems, books from the Old and New Testaments, and

  abstract =     {A Funeral Elegy was written in February 1612 by "W. S.," a
                  poet of "name and credit" closely familiar with Shakespearean
                  texts. The pamphlet was registered by a stationer, Thomas
                  Thorp, whose livelihood depended chiefly on the
                  Shakespeare-Jonson theatrical circle and who had published
                  Shakespeare's Sonnets in 1609. Privately issued and surviving
                  in just two copies, A Funeral Elegy received scant notice
                  until 1989, when I first presented archival, statistical, and
                  literary evidence that WS could be William Shakespeare.
                  Focusing on intertextual evidence derived in part from new
                  electronic resources, this essay addresses a vexing conundrum:
                  the elegy is aesthetically disappointing and yet distinctively
                  Shakespearean-a paradox that raises larger questions about
                  attributional methodology and canonical theory. An emerging
                  scholarly consensus supports a Shakespearean attribution for
                  the elegy, though the poem challenges prevailing notions of
                  what it is that makes Shakespeare "Shakespeare."},

  shorttitle =   {The {{Public Face}} of {{Modernism}}},
  abstract =     {Between the 1890s and the 1920s, mass consumer culture and
                  modernism grew up together, by most accounts as mutual
                  antagonists. This provocative work of cultural history tells a
                  different story.~ By delving deeply into the publishing and
                  promotional practices of the modernists in Britain and
                  America, however, Mark Morrisson reveals that their
                  engagements with the commercial mass market were in fact
                  extensive and diverse. ~~~ The phenomenal successes of new
                  advertising agencies and mass market publishers did elicit
                  what Morrisson calls a "crisis of publicity" for some
                  modernists and for many concerned citizens in both countries.
                  But, as Morrisson demonstrates, the vast influence of these
                  industries on consumers also had a profound and largely
                  overlooked effect upon many modernist authors, artists, and
                  others. By exploring the publicity and audience reception of
                  several of the most important modernist magazines of the
                  period, The Public Face of Modernism shows how modernists, far
                  from lamenting the destruction of meaningful art and public
                  culture by the new mass market, actually displayed optimism
                  about the power of mass-market technologies and strategies to
                  transform and rejuvenate contemporary culture--and, above all,
                  to restore a public function to art. ~~~ This reconstruction
                  of the "public face of modernism" offers surprising new
                  perceptions about the class, gender, racial, and even
                  generational tensions within the public culture of the early
                  part of the century, and provides a rare insight into the
                  actual audiences for modernist magazines of the period.~
                  Moreover, in new readings of works by James Joyce, George
                  Bernard Shaw, Wyndham Lewis, Ford Madox Ford, T. S. Eliot,
                  William Carlos Williams, and many others, Morrisson shows that
                  these contexts also had an impact on the techniques and
                  concerns of the literature itself.},

  abstract =     {Little magazines made modernism. These unconventional,
                  noncommercial publications may have brought writers such as
                  James Joyce, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, Mina
                  Loy, and Wallace Stevens to the world but, as Eric Bulson
                  shows in Little Magazine, World Form, their reach and
                  importance extended far beyond Europe and the United States.
                  By investigating the global and transnational itineraries of
                  the little-magazine form, Bulson uncovers a worldwide network
                  that influenced the development of literature and criticism in
                  Africa, the West Indies, the Pacific Rim, and South America.In
                  addition to identifying how these circulations and exchanges
                  worked, Bulson also addresses equally formative moments of
                  disconnection and immobility. British and American writers who
                  fled to Europe to escape Anglo-American provincialism,
                  refugees from fascism, wandering surrealists, and displaced
                  communists all contributed to the proliferation of print. Yet
                  the little magazine was equally crucial to literary production
                  and consumption in the postcolonial world, where it helped
                  connect newly independent African nations. Bulson concludes
                  with reflections on the digitization of these defunct little
                  magazines and what it means for our ongoing desire to
                  understand modernism’s global dimensions in the past and its
                  digital afterlife.},

                  commonly held views of the radical nature of literary
                  modernism. She positions the coterie of writers centred around
                  Pound, Eliot and Joyce as one among a number of groups in
                  Britain intent on redefining the cultural work of literature
                  at the turn of the twentieth century. Ardis emphasizes the
                  ways in which modernists secured their cultural centrality,
                  she documents their support of mainstream attitudes toward
                  science, their retreat from a supposed valuing of scandalous
                  sexuality in the wake of Oscar Wilde's trials in 1895, and the
                  conservative cultural and sexual politics masked by their

                  opposition to modernist self-fashioning in British socialism
                  and feminism of the period. Ardis goes on to consider how
                  literary modernism's rise to aesthetic prominence paved the
                  way for the institutionalization of English studies through
                  the devaluation of other aesthetic practices.},

                  Clifford Wulfman argue, then the study of modern culture
                  should begin with these publications. Scholes and Wulfman’s
                  radically inclusive approach not only considers the “little”
                  modernist magazines alongside the “big” or mass magazines
                  often dismissed as antithetical to modernism’s elite culture,
                  but also insists that scholars must investigate their contents
                  as a whole—from poetry to advertising—to appreciate their full
                  significance. The book’s appendix also reprints a previously
                  uncollected critique of popular British magazines from 1917
                  and 1918 by Ezra Pound.},

  abstract =     {A Geneology of Modernism is a study of literary transition in
                  the first two decades of the twentieth-century, a period of
                  extraordinary ferment and great accomplishment, during which
                  the avant-garde gradually consolidated a secure place within
                  English culture. Michael Levenson analyses that complex
                  process by following the successive phases of a literary
                  movement - Impressionist, Imagist, Vorticist, Classicist - as
                  it attempted to formulate the principles on which a new
                  aesthetic might be founded. The emphasis here falls on the
                  ideology of modernism, but throughout the book the ideological
                  question is tied on the one hand to specific literary works
                  and on the other to general movements in philosophy and the
                  fine arts. The major figures under discussion, Joseph Conrad,
                  Ford Madox Ford, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, and T. S. Elliot,
                  are placed in relation to thinkers who have been largely
                  neglected in the history of modernism: Max Stirner, Wilhelm
                  Worringer, Pierre Lasserre, Allen Upward, and Hilaire Belloc.
                  Levenson thus situates the emergence of a modernist aesthetic
                  within the context of literary theory, literary practice, and
                  cultural history.},

                  your applications with this guide.Who This Book Is
                  ForStudents, researchers and data scientists who wish to learn
                  Bayesian data analysis with Python and implement probabilistic
                  models in their day to day projects. Programming experience
                  with Python is essential. No previous statistical knowledge is
                  assumed.What You Will Learn- Understand the essentials
                  Bayesian concepts from a practical point of view- Learn how to
                  build probabilistic models using the Python library PyMC3-
                  Acquire the skills to sanity-check your models and modify them
                  if necessary- Add structure to your models and get the
                  advantages of hierarchical models- Find out how different
                  models can be used to answer different data analysis questions
                  - When in doubt, learn to choose between alternative models.-
                  Predict continuous target outcomes using regression analysis
                  or assign classes using logistic and softmax regression.-
                  Learn how to think probabilistically and unleash the power and
                  flexibility of the Bayesian frameworkIn DetailThe purpose of
                  this book is to teach the main concepts of Bayesian data
                  analysis. We will learn how to effectively use PyMC3, a Python
                  library for probabilistic programming, to perform Bayesian
                  parameter estimation, to check models and validate them. This
                  book begins presenting the key concepts of the Bayesian
                  framework and the main advantages of this approach from a
                  practical point of view. Moving on, we will explore the power
                  and flexibility of generalized linear models and how to adapt
                  them to a wide array of problems, including regression and
                  classification. We will also look into mixture models and
                  clustering data, and we will finish with advanced topics like
                  non-parametrics models and Gaussian processes. With the help
                  of Python and PyMC3 you will learn to implement, check and
                  expand Bayesian models to solve data analysis problems.Style
                  and approachBayes algorithms are widely used in statistics,
                  machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data mining.
                  This will be a practical guide allowing the readers to use
                  Bayesian methods for statistical modelling and analysis using
                  Python.},

  abstract =     {The fiery and enigmatic masterpiece—one of the greatest novels
                  of the Modernist era. Nightwood, Djuna Barnes' strange and
                  sinuous tour de force, "belongs to that small class of books
                  that somehow reflect a time or an epoch" (Times Literary
                  Supplement). That time is the period between the two World
                  Wars, and Barnes' novel unfolds in the decadent shadows of
                  Europe's great cities, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna—a world in
                  which the boundaries of class, religion, and sexuality are
                  bold but surprisingly porous. The outsized characters who
                  inhabit this world are some of the most memorable in all of
                  fiction—there is Guido Volkbein, the Wandering Jew and son of
                  a self-proclaimed baron; Robin Vote, the American expatriate
                  who marries him and then engages in a series of affairs, first
                  with Nora Flood and then with Jenny Petherbridge, driving all
                  of her lovers to distraction with her passion for wandering
                  alone in the night; and there is Dr.
                  Matthew-Mighty-Grain-of-Salt-Dante-O'Connor, a transvestite
                  and ostensible gynecologist, whose digressive speeches brim
                  with fury, keen insights, and surprising allusions. Barnes'
                  depiction of these characters and their relationships (Nora
                  says, "A man is another persona woman is yourself, caught as
                  you turn in panic; on her mouth you kiss your own") has made
                  the novel a landmark of feminist and lesbian literature. Most
                  striking of all is Barnes' unparalleled stylistic innovation,
                  which led T. S. Eliot to proclaim the book "so good a novel

                  eminent English novelist and essayist E. M. Forster
                  (1879-1970) displays an unusually perceptive view of British
                  society in the early 20th century. Written in 1908, A Room
                  with a View is a social comedy set in Florence, Italy, and
                  Surrey, England. Its heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, struggling
                  against straitlaced Victorian attitudes of arrogance,
                  narrow-mindedness and snobbery, falls in love-while on holiday
                  in Italy-with the socially unsuitable George Emerson. Caught
                  up in a claustrophobic world of pretentiousness and rigidity,
                  Lucy ultimately rejects her fiancé, Cecil Vyse, and chooses,
                  instead, to wed her true love, the young man whose sense of
                  freedom and lack of artificiality became apparent to her in
                  the Italian pensione where they first met. This classic
                  exploration of passion, human nature and social convention is

                  introduction expands on why, according to the late Freud,
                  psychoanalysis is the key to understanding individual and
                  collective realities or, better yet, collective truths. The
                  Appendices include related writings by Freud, contemporary
                  reviews, and scholarly responses from Marcuse, Rieff, and
                  Ricoeur.},

                  of the ordinary, catch with the tail of my eye some far

                  experimental, daring and challenging, The Waves is regarded by
                  many as Virginia Woolf's greatest achievement. It follows a
                  set of six friends from childhood to middle age as they
                  experience the world around them and explore who they are and
                  what itmeans to be alive. As the contours of their lives are
                  revealed, a unique novel is slowly unveiled. Enfolded within
                  Woolf's lyrical and mysterious language, the mundane takes on
                  a startling new significance while distant pasts are no less
                  in play than the clamorous sounds and kaleidoscopic sights
                  ofthe modern city. Yet precisely where the alluringly
                  enigmatic pages of The Waves are leading, and what deeper
                  meanings are held within its undulant chapters and shimmering
                  interludes, are questions that have never ceased to enthral
                  readers and critics alike.In this new edition David Bradshaw
                  considers the spellbinding oddness and originality of The
                  Waves, helping the reader to negotiate a way though this most
                  poetic and haunting of novels.ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100

  abstract =     {Over a hundred and fifty years after its initial publication,
                  Emily Brontë's turbulent portrayal of the Earnshaws and the
                  Lintons, two northern English households nearly destroyed by
                  violent passions in the last quarter of the eighteenth
                  century, continues to provoke and fascinate readers.
                  Heathcliff remains one of the best-known characters in the
                  English novel, and Catherine Earnshaw's impossible choice
                  between two rivals retains its appeal for contemporary
                  readers. At the same time, the novel's highly ambivalent
                  representations of domesticity, its famous reticence about its
                  characters and their actions, its formal features as a story
                  within a story, and the mystery of Heathcliff's origins and
                  identity provide material for classroom discussion at every
                  level of study. The introduction and appendices to this
                  Broadview edition, which place Brontë's life and novel in the
                  context of the developing "Brontë myth," explore the impact of
                  industrialization on the people of Yorkshire, consider the
                  novel's representation of gender, and survey the ways
                  contemporary scholarship has sought to account for Heathcliff,
                  open up multiple contexts within which Wuthering Heights can
                  be read, understood, and enjoyed.},

                  Published in serial form in 1868, it was inspired in part by a
                  spectacular murder case widely reported in the early 1860s.
                  Collins’s story revolves around a diamond stolen from a Hindu
                  holy place. On her eighteenth birthday, Rachel Verinder
                  receives the diamond, but by the following morning the stone
                  has been stolen again. As the story unravels through multiple
                  eyewitness accounts, the elderly Sergeant Cuff—with a face
                  “sharp as a hatchet”—looks for the culprit. One of Collins’s

  abstract =     {Du Maurier’s Trilby was the novel sensation of the 1890s. Du
                  Maurier had spent a good deal of his life as a child and later
                  as an art student in Paris; when he turned from his career in
                  journalism and magazine illustration to novel writing he found
                  enormous success with a novel divided as his own life had been
                  between Paris and London. Billee, an English artist living the
                  Bohemian life abroad, meets and falls in love with Trilby, a
                  Parisian model. Differences in social class doom their
                  romance, but Trilby, taught by the mysterious hypnotist
                  Svengali to sing like “some enchanted princess” becomes a
                  famous entertainer. As it turns out, however, her talent and
                  her possession of her own mind have become dependent on
                  Svengali maintaining his spell over her. Originally serialized
                  in Harper’s Monthly in 1894, Trilby was published with 120
                  illustrations by the author (who was also a celebrated
                  caricaturist for Punch). All 120 illustrations were included
                  in the Harper and Brothers New York edition of 1894, and in a
                  British edition published the following year in London. The
                  first British publication in book form, however, (by Osgood \&
                  McIlvaine in 1894) did not include any of Du Maurier’s
                  illustrations, and many editions since that time have included
                  no illustrations or reproduced only a selection of the
                  illustrations. Particularly given that many of the
                  illustrations are integrated into the page of text in which
                  they appear, Trilby is ideally suited to be made available
                  again in a facsimile reprint. In its first year of
                  publication, the book sold over 200,000 copies, and before
                  long it had also been adapted for the stage. The name
                  “Svengali” came to be applied to any hypnotist and the image
                  of Svengali carved a lasting place in the popular imagination.
                  Perhaps the most important expression of 1890s Bohemianism,
                  Trilby has also attracted interest in recent years on account
                  of its presentation of hypnosis and split personality, and for
                  the conflicted but often anti-Semitic presentation of the
                  mysterious Svengali. This is one of a series from Broadview
                  Press of facsimile reprint editions—editions that provide
                  readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians

  abstract =     {The last twenty years have seen an explosion in the
                  development of information technology, to the point that
                  people spend a major portion of waking life in online spaces.
                  While there are enormous benefits associated with this
                  technology, there are also risks that can affect the most
                  vulnerable in our society but also the most confident.
                  Cybercrime and its victims explores the social construction of
                  violence and victimisation in online spaces and brings
                  together scholars from many areas of inquiry, including
                  criminology, sociology, and cultural, media, and gender
                  studies. The book is organised thematically into five parts.
                  Part one addresses some broad conceptual and theoretical
                  issues. Part two is concerned with issues relating to sexual
                  violence, abuse, and exploitation, as well as to sexual
                  expression online. Part three addresses issues related to race
                  and culture. Part four addresses concerns around cyberbullying
                  and online suicide, grouped together as ‘social violence’. The
                  final part argues that victims of cybercrime are, in general,
                  neglected and not receiving the recognition and support they
                  need and deserve. It concludes that in the volatile and
                  complex world of cyberspace continued awareness-raising is
                  essential for bringing attention to the plight of victims. It
                  also argues that there needs to be more support of all kinds
                  for victims, as well as an increase in the exposure and
                  punishment of perpetrators. Drawing on a range of pressing
                  contemporary issues such as online grooming, sexting,
                  cyber-hate, cyber-bulling and online radicalization, this book
                  examines how cyberspace makes us more vulnerable to crime and
                  violence, how it gives rise to new forms of surveillance and
                  social control and how cybercrime can be prevented.},

  abstract =     {The videogame scene has evolved from the hobby of boys in
                  bedrooms to a popular pastime for anyone with a smartphone.
                  Many of the old guard resent this mainstreaming of games
                  culture — and they’ve been anything but welcoming. These
                  trolls have created a climate of fear by abusing and harassing
                  women, minorities and anyone who has dared to speak out
                  against misogyny and other problems in the boys’ club
                  industry. Game Changers puts these conflicts under the
                  microscope, in Australia and overseas. The book features
                  exclusive interviews with many key figures working to make the
                  videogame world a safe space, including Anita Sarkeesian and
                  Zoë Quinn, two of the women at the centre of the Gamergate
                  abuse. In 2015, they were asked by the United Nations to lead
                  a panel discussion on the ‘rising tide of online violence
                  against women and girls’. Authors Dan Golding and Leena van
                  Deventer use their extensive experience in the videogame
                  industry, both as players and professionals, to examine how
                  games culture is growing, diversifying and changing for the

                  cost. In some cases, the final result is suicide. Bullying,
                  stalking, and trolling are just the beginning. Extreme
                  examples such as GamerGate get publicized, but otherwise the
                  online abuse of women is largely underreported. Haters
                  combines a history of online sexism with suggestions for
                  solutions. Using current events and the latest available
                  research into cybersexism, Bailey Poland questions the
                  motivations behind cybersexist activities and explores methods

  abstract =     {Internet trolls live to upset as many people as possible,
                  using all the technical and psychological tools at their
                  disposal. They gleefully whip the media into a frenzy over a
                  fake teen drug crisis; they post offensive messages on
                  Facebook memorial pages, traumatizing grief-stricken friends
                  and family; they use unabashedly racist language and images.
                  They take pleasure in ruining a complete stranger's day and
                  find amusement in their victim's anguish. In short, trolling
                  is the obstacle to a kinder, gentler Internet. To quote a
                  famous Internet meme, trolling is why we can't have nice
                  things online. Or at least that's what we have been led to
                  believe. In this provocative book, Whitney Phillips argues
                  that trolling, widely condemned as obscene and deviant,
                  actually fits comfortably within the contemporary media
                  landscape. Trolling may be obscene, but, Phillips argues, it
                  isn't all that deviant. Trolls' actions are born of and fueled
                  by culturally sanctioned impulses -- which are just as
                  damaging as the trolls' most disruptive behaviors. Phillips
                  describes, for example, the relationship between trolling and
                  sensationalist corporate media -- pointing out that for
                  trolls, exploitation is a leisure activity; for media, it's a
                  business strategy. She shows how trolls, "the grimacing poster
                  children for a socially networked world," align with social
                  media. And she documents how trolls, in addition to parroting
                  media tropes, also offer a grotesque pantomime of dominant
                  cultural tropes, including gendered notions of dominance and
                  success and an ideology of entitlement. We don't just have a
                  trolling problem, Phillips argues; we have a culture problem.
                  This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things isn't only about trolls;
                  it's about a culture in which trolls thrive.},

                  policies to decide whether to remove content or take action
                  against the alleged harasser--or not. On Twitter, harassing
                  accounts can be deleted entirely, suspended (with content made

                  in the English-language Wikipedia, specifically focusing on
                  autonomous editing programs and assisted editing tools. This
                  qualitative research builds on recent research in which we
                  quantitatively demonstrate the growing prevalence of such
                  software in recent years. Using trace ethnography, we show how
                  these often-unofficial technologies have fundamentally
                  transformed the nature of editing and administration in
                  Wikipedia. Specifically, we analyze "vandal fighting" as an
                  epistemic process of distributed cognition, highlighting the
                  role of non-human actors in enabling a decentralized activity
                  of collective intelligence. In all, this case shows that
                  software programs are used for more than enforcing policies
                  and standards. These tools enable coordinated yet
                  decentralized action, independent of the specific norms

  isbn =         {978-0-226-19244-4},
  abstract =     {Few virtues are as celebrated in contemporary culture as
                  openness. Rooted in software culture and carrying more than a
                  whiff of Silicon Valley technical utopianism, openness—of
                  decision-making, data, and organizational structure—is seen as
                  the cure for many problems in politics and business. ~ But
                  what does openness mean, and what would a political theory of
                  openness look like? With Wikipedia and the Politics of
                  Openness, Nathaniel Tkacz uses Wikipedia, the most prominent
                  product of open organization, to analyze the theory and
                  politics of openness in practice—and to break its spell.
                  Through discussions of edit wars, article deletion policies,
                  user access levels, and more, Tkacz enables us to see how the
                  key concepts of openness—including collaboration, ad-hocracy,
                  and the splitting of contested projects through “forking”—play
                  out in reality. ~ The resulting book is the richest critical
                  analysis of openness to date, one that roots media theory in
                  messy reality and thereby helps us move beyond the vaporware
                  promises of digital utopians and take the first steps toward
                  truly understanding what openness does, and does not, have to
                  offer.},

  abstract =     {Resolving Semantic Ambiguity arrrays the work of leading
                  theorists on the issues surrounding the meaning and
                  interpretation of ambiguous text. The chapters are organized
                  around three major themes: (1) retrieval, (2) representation
                  of words, and (3) text as a context. The book offers a number
                  of new challenges to the role of context in language
                  processing, some striking new evidence on the repetition of
                  homographs in different contexts, and new approaches to
                  resolution capable of being incorporated into either modular
                  or network models. In several papers the problem of ambiguity
                  is extended to include the problem of weak ambiguity and
                  understanding text themes. The book provides a unique starting
                  point for researchers approaching the problems of meaning in
                  cognitive science, psychology, and computational linguistics.},

  abstract =     {Trust and Reputation Systems constitute an essential part of
                  many social networks due to the great expansion of these
                  on-line communities in the past few years. As a consequence of
                  this growth, some users try to disturb the normal atmosphere
                  of these communities, or even to take advantage of them in
                  order to obtain some kind of benefits. Therefore, the concept
                  of trust is a key point in the performance of on-line systems
                  such as on-line marketplaces, review aggregators, social news
                  sites, and forums. In this work we propose a method to compute
                  a ranking of the users in a social network, regarding their
                  trustworthiness. The aim of our method is to prevent malicious
                  users from illicitly gaining high reputation in the network by
                  demoting them in the ranking of users. We propose a novel
                  system intended to propagate both positive and negative
                  opinions of the users through a network, in such way that the
                  opinions from each user about others influence their global
                  trust score. Our proposal has been evaluated in different
                  challenging situations. The experiments include the generation
                  of random graphs, the use of a real-world dataset extracted
                  from a social news site, and a combination of both a real
                  dataset and generation techniques, in order to test our
                  proposals in different environments. The results show that our
                  method performs well in every situations, showing the
                  propagation of trust and distrust to be a reliable mechanism

                  pattern detection to develop a theory of global textual
                  transmission as a process of turbulent flow. Specifically, it
                  models stream-of-consciousness narration as a discrete set of
                  linguistic features and rhetorical elements and uses this
                  model to track the movement of this modernist technique across
                  generic boundaries (from anglophone modernism to more popular
                  genres) and linguistic ones (from English to Japanese).
                  Oscillating between statistical models and moments of close
                  reading, the article shows how a quantitatively scaled-up
                  approach, rather than reinforcing an image of global textual
                  flows as singular and monolithic, illuminates world literature
                  as a system constituted by patterns of divergence in structure
                  and of difference in sameness.},

  abstract =     {The first of Trollope’s Barsetshire novels, The Warden
                  concerns the moral dilemma of the Reverend Septimus Harding,
                  who finds himself at the centre of a bitter conflict between
                  defenders of Church privilege and the reforming impulses of
                  the mid-Victorian period. Appointed warden of an almshouse, he
                  is given a comfortable salary from its founder’s will to
                  oversee the institution and the small weekly incomes given to
                  the men who live there. Mr. Harding’s disproportionate salary,
                  however, becomes a source of concern for a local reformer who
                  denounces the allocation of funds as a Church abuse.
                  Interweaving the complexities of the Victorian world, the
                  novel draws on ecclesiastical scandals, criticizes the power
                  of the press, satirizes the law, and examines the growing
                  influence of London on provincial life. Based on the most
                  authoritative text published during Trollope’s life, that of
                  1878, the Broadview edition also includes appendices with
                  material relating to the novel’s genesis, Trollope’s
                  revisions, the sources of his literary parody, the historical
                  background to the novel’s topical references, its reception by

                  attention to detail, and whose writing illustrates the complex
                  and mutually informing relationship between the local and the
                  global. Reading Joyce's stories in the context of the
                  \emph{Irish Homestead} (1895–1923), the journal of Ireland's
                  agricultural cooperative movement, reveals how his stories
                  borrow the regionalism of the journal's editorials and fiction
                  but are distinguished by the use of modernist narrative
                  techniques. This regional affect defines Joyce's modernism as
                  grounded in the local ecology, history, and culture of his

  abstract =     {The verse and criticism which he produced during the early
                  years of the twentieth century very largely determined the
                  directions of creative writing in our time; virtually every
                  major poet in England and America today has acknowledged his
                  help or influence. Pound's lyric genius, his superb technique,
                  and his fresh insight into literary problems make him one of
                  the small company of men who through the centuries have kept
                  poetry alive—one of the great innovators.This book offers a
                  compact yet representative selection of Ezra Pound's poems and
                  translations. The span covered is Pound's entire writing
                  career, from his early lyrics and the translations of
                  Provençal songs to his English version of Sophocles'
                  Trachiniae. Included are parts of his best known works—the
                  Chinese translations, the sequence called Hugh Selwyn
                  Mauberly, the Homage to Sextus Propertius. The Cantos, Pound's
                  major epic, are presented in generous selections, chosen to

  abstract =     {Stanley Fish is one of America's most stimulating literary
                  theorists. In this book, he undertakes a profound
                  reexamination of some of criticism's most basic assumptions.
                  He penetrates to the core of the modern debate about
                  interpretation, explodes numerous misleading formulations, and
                  offers a stunning proposal for a new way of thinking about the
                  way we read. Fish begins by examining the relation between a
                  reader and a text, arguing against the formalist belief that
                  the text alone is the basic, knowable, neutral, and unchanging
                  component of literary experience. But in arguing for the right
                  of the reader to interpret and in effect create the literary
                  work, he skillfully avoids the old trap of subjectivity. To
                  claim that each reader essentially participates in the making
                  of a poem or novel is not, he shows, an invitation to
                  unchecked subjectivity and to the endless proliferation of
                  competing interpretations. For each reader approaches a
                  literary work not as an isolated individual but as part of a
                  community of readers. 'Indeed," he writes, "it is interpretive
                  communities, rather than either the text or reader, that
                  produce meanings." The book is developmental, not static. Fish
                  at all times reveals the evolutionary aspect of his work--the
                  manner in which he has assumed new positions, altered them,
                  and then moved on. Previously published essays are introduced
                  by headnotes which relate them to the central notion of
                  interpretive communities as it emerges in the final chapters.
                  In the course of refining his theory, Fish includes rather
                  than excludes the thinking of other critics and shows how
                  often they agree with him, even when he and they may appear to
                  be most dramatically at odds. Engaging, lucid, provocative,
                  this book will immediately find its place among the seminal
                  works of modern literary criticism.},

                  on early modernism in 20th?century literature, late modernism
                  has only belatedly appeared in the critical discourse. This
                  article presents a survey of criticism on thirties writing and
                  writing between the World Wars in order to suggest that the
                  early success of Auden Generation criticism narrowed the scope
                  of the critical field. Since the late 1990s, a critical
                  reassessment of writing between the late twenties and late
                  forties has facilitated the emergence of late modernism.
                  Combining cultural and historical assessment with attention to
                  the period?s plurality of aesthetics, these contributions are
                  vital to the theorization of late modernism beyond the dyadic
                  model of the Auden Generation and to an analysis of late
                  modernism that examines the conceptual work these texts
                  perform in relation to modernist and postmodernist modalities.
                  Drawing together the approaches of recent theorists of late
                  modernism, this article concludes by offering an alternative
                  framework for mapping a plurality of late modernist writers,
                  one that examines late modernist poetics in relation to

  abstract =     {In the collection of essays On Late Style, Edward Said
                  reflects on the new idiom achieved by great artists in their
                  work near the end of their lives as “late style.” Drawing on
                  Adorno's essay on Beethoven's late style, Said also focuses on
                  the aesthetic aspects of lateness. Defining the late works of
                  artists as “a form of exile,” however, Said moves beyond
                  Adorno's aesthetic conception of late style. Highlighting the
                  artist's abandonment of communication with the established
                  social order, who achieves a contradictory, alienated
                  relationship with it instead, Said compares artistic lateness
                  with the experience of the subject in exile. Drawing on the
                  analogy provided by Said, this article argues that the
                  relationship between “self” and “other” in the different
                  theoretical contexts of Postcolonial Studies and Age Studies
                  can be usefully combined in the composite concept of “late
                  style as exile.” In order to explore how the concept of

  abstract =     {Modern European literature has traditionally been seen as a
                  series of attempts to assert successive styles of writing as
                  'new'. In this groundbreaking study, Ben Hutchinson argues
                  that literary modernity can in fact be understood not as that
                  which is new, but as that which is 'late'. Exploring the ways
                  in which European literature repeatedly defines itself through
                  a sense of senescence or epigonality, Hutchinson shows that
                  the shifting manifestations of lateness since romanticism
                  express modernity's continuing quest for legitimacy. With
                  reference to a wide range of authors--from Mary Shelley,
                  Chateaubriand, and Immermann, via Baudelaire, Henry James, and
                  Nietzsche, to Valery, Djuna Barnes, and Adorno--he combines
                  close readings of canonical texts with historical and
                  theoretical comparisons of numerous national contexts. Out of
                  this broad comparative sweep emerges a taxonomy of lateness,
                  of the diverse ways in which modern writers can be understood,
                  in the words of Nietzsche, as 'creatures facing backwards'.
                  Ambitious and original, Lateness and Modern European
                  Literature offers a significant new model for understanding
                  literary modernity."},

                  approach to explore key aspects of Lawrence's late style. The
                  evolution and meaning of the poems are considered in relation
                  to Lawrence's prose works of this period, including Sketches
                  of Etruscan Places, Lady Chatterley's Lover, and Apocalypse.
                  More broadly, Jones shows that Lawrence's late works are
                  products of a complex process of textual assimilation, as she
                  uncovers the importance of Lawrence's reading in mythology,
                  cosmology, primitivism, mysticism, astronomy, and astrology.
                  The result is a book that highlights the richness and
                  diversity of his poetic output, also prioritizing the
                  masterpieces of Lawrence's mature style which are as

                  Adorno’s reading of Beethoven’s middle and late styles as
                  essentially dichotomous. Specifically, Adorno holds that the
                  middle-style works express the utter interdependency of the
                  subjective and objective spheres in their emphasis upon
                  organic wholeness and totality. By contrast, the late-style
                  works express the alienation of subject from object in
                  isolating and laying bare musical conventions. Yet middle
                  Beethoven, as Adorno himself intimates, often calls organic
                  unity into question, especially with respect to the
                  recapitulation and coda in a sonata-form piece. Moreover,
                  although Adorno does not seem to acknowledge it, the middle
                  style exhibits fragmentation both in partitioning the sonata
                  principle into subprinciples and, more concretely, in
                  partitioning a theme into various subcomponents. Conversely,
                  using Schenkerian techniques, one can expose sub-thematic
                  unity underlying foreground fragmentation in the late works
                  (as demonstrated by Daniel Chua and Kevin Korsyn). Drawing on
                  Schenker’s reading, I use Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in A, op.
                  101 as a case study. In the second half of the essay I
                  confront the political connotations of Adorno’s argument,
                  again problematizing particular stylistic binarisms with
                  respect to issues of freedom, solidarity, and hope.},

  abstract =     {When Shakespeare gave up tragedy around 1607 and turned to the
                  new form we call romance or tragicomedy, he created a
                  distinctive poetic idiom that often bewildered audiences and
                  readers. The plays of this period, Pericles, Cymbeline, The
                  Winter's Tale, The Tempest, as well as Shakespeare's part in
                  the collaborations with John Fletcher (Henry VIII and The Two
                  Noble Kinsmen), exhibit a challenging verse style - verbally
                  condensed, metrically and syntactically sophisticated, both
                  conversational and highly wrought. In Shakespeare's Late
                  Style, McDonald anatomizes the components of this late style,
                  illustrating in a series of topically organized chapters the
                  contribution of such features as ellipsis, grammatical
                  suspension, and various forms of repetition. Resisting the
                  sentimentality that frequently attends discussion of an
                  artist's 'late' period, Shakespeare's Late Style shows how the
                  poetry of the last plays reveals their creator's ambivalent
                  attitude towards art, language, men and women, the theatre,

                  writer, artist or composer? And what exactly do we mean by
                  'late Shakespeare'? Gordon McMullan argues that, far from
                  being a natural phenomenon common to a handful of geniuses in
                  old age or in proximity to death, late style is in fact a
                  critical construct. Taking Shakespeare as his exemplar, he
                  maps the development of the 'discourse of lateness' from the
                  eighteenth century to the present, noting not only the
                  mismatch between that discourse and the actual conditions for
                  authorship in early modern theatre but also its generativity
                  for subsequent projections of creative selfhood. He thus
                  offers the first critique of the idea of late style, which
                  will be of interest not only to literature specialists but
                  also to art historians, musicologists and anyone curious about

                  strategies of self-protection and self-projection--textual and

                  age to enhance posterity's view of themselves and their work.
                  The four figures examined here in detail--Robert Browning,
                  Alfred Tennyson, Henry James, and Thomas Hardy--sought to
                  maintain their personal privacy and control the integrity of
                  their texts by, for example, destroying documents, writing
                  autobiographies, revising their earlier works and supplying
                  them with retrospective prefaces, and publishing so-called
                  "collected" editions that omitted items they no longer wished
                  to preserve. These and other strategies have been widely
                  practiced by writers, but can have entirely unanticipated
                  results, as Millgate shows. His study also examines the
                  difficult role of such literary executors as Pen Browning,
                  Hallam Tennyson, and Florence Hardy, called upon to exercise a
                  delegated, hence compromised, authority. The final section of
                  the book considers the wills and wishes of many other literary
                  figures, from Samuel Johnson to Walt Whitman to Philip Larkin,
                  emphasizing the importance for contemporary biographers and
                  editors of attention to these end-games--to the often
                  disregarded final years of writers, and to both the intentions

                  survey but also a significant reassessment of Modernism
                  itself.Spanning many decades, illuminating individual
                  achievements and locating them within the intersecting
                  histories of experiment (Symbolism to Surrealism, Naturalism
                  to Expressionism, Futurism to Dadaism), the book places the
                  transformations of culture alongside the agitations of
                  modernity (war, revolution, feminism, psychoanalysis). In this
                  perspective, Modernism must be understood more broadly than
                  simply in terms of its provocative works, experimental forms,
                  and singular careers. Rather, as Levenson demonstrates,
                  Modernism should be viewed as the emergence of an adversary
                  culture of the New that depended on audiences as well as
                  artists, enemies as well as supporters.},

                  under two different instructional conditions: to generate
                  visual mental images of the words' referents, or to simply
                  listen to each word and wait for the next word. Analyses were
                  performed which directly compared the regional brain activity
                  during each condition, with the goal of discovering whether
                  mental image generation engages modality-specific visual
                  areas, whether it engages primary visual cortex, and whether
                  it recruits the left hemisphere to a greater extent than the
                  right. Results revealed that visual association cortex, and
                  not primary visual cortex, was engaged during the mental image
                  generation condition. Left inferior temporal lobe (Brodmann's
                  area 37) was the most reliably and robustly activated area
                  across subjects, but some subjects had activity which extended
                  superiorly into occipital association cortex (area 19). The
                  results of this experiment support the hypothesis that visual
                  mental imagery is a function of visual association cortex, and
                  that image generation is asymmetrically localized to the

  abstract =     {Visual imagery is a form of sensory imagination, involving
                  subjective experiences typically described as similar to
                  perception, but which occur in the absence of corresponding
                  external stimuli. We used the Activation Likelihood Estimation
                  algorithm (ALE) to identify regions consistently activated by
                  visual imagery across 40 neuroimaging studies, the first such
                  meta-analysis. We also employed a recently developed
                  multi-modal parcellation of the human brain to attribute
                  stereotactic co-ordinates to one of 180 anatomical regions,
                  the first time this approach has been combined with the ALE
                  algorithm. We identified a total 634 foci, based on
                  measurements from 464 participants. Our overall comparison
                  identified activation in the superior parietal lobule,
                  particularly in the left hemisphere, consistent with the
                  proposed ‘top-down’ role for this brain region in imagery.
                  Inferior premotor areas and the inferior frontal sulcus were
                  reliably activated, a finding consistent with the prominent
                  semantic demands made by many visual imagery tasks. We
                  observed bilateral activation in several areas associated with
                  the integration of eye movements and visual information,
                  including the supplementary and cingulate eye fields (SCEFs)
                  and the frontal eye fields (FEFs), suggesting that enactive
                  processes are important in visual imagery. V1 was typically
                  activated during visual imagery, even when participants have
                  their eyes closed, consistent with influential depictive
                  theories of visual imagery. Temporal lobe activation was
                  restricted to area PH and regions of the fusiform gyrus,
                  adjacent to the fusiform face complex (FFC). These results
                  provide a secure foundation for future work to characterise in
                  greater detail the functional contributions of specific areas
                  to visual imagery.},

  abstract =     {For most people the use of visual imagery is pervasive in
                  daily life, but for a small group of people the experience of
                  visual imagery is entirely unknown. Research based on
                  subjective phenomenology indicates that otherwise healthy
                  people can completely lack the experience of visual imagery, a
                  condition now referred to as aphantasia. As congenital
                  aphantasia has thus far been based on subjective reports, it
                  remains unclear whether individuals are really unable to
                  imagine visually, or if they have very poor metacognition –
                  they have images in their mind, but are blind to them. Here we
                  measured sensory imagery in subjectively self-diagnosed
                  aphantasics, using the binocular rivalry paradigm, as well as
                  measuring their self-rated object and spatial imagery with
                  multiple questionnaires (VVIQ, SUIS and OSIQ). Unlike, the
                  general population, experimentally naive aphantasics showed
                  almost no imagery-based rivalry priming. Aphantasic
                  participants' self-rated visual object imagery was
                  significantly below average, however their spatial imagery
                  scores were above average. These data suggest that aphantasia
                  is a condition involving a lack of sensory and phenomenal
                  imagery, and not a lack of metacognition. The possible
                  underlying neurological cause of aphantasia is discussed as
                  well as future research directions.},

                  two groups were matched on measures of age, IQ, memory and
                  mood but differed significantly in imagery vividness. We used
                  fMRI to examine brain activation while participants looked at,
                  or later imagined, famous faces and famous buildings. Group
                  comparison revealed that the low-vividness group activated a
                  more widespread set of brain regions while visualising than
                  the high-vividness group. Parametric analysis of brain
                  activation in relation to imagery vividness across the entire
                  group of participants revealed distinct patterns of positive
                  and negative correlation. In particular, several posterior
                  cortical regions show a positive correlation with imagery
                  vividness: regions of the fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate

                  cortices (BAs 17 and 18) displayed exclusively negative

  abstract =     {Previous research suggests that the right hemisphere (RH) may
                  contribute uniquely to the processing of metaphoric language.
                  However, most studies have focused on familiar metaphoric
                  expressions. The present study used the divided visual field
                  paradigm to examine the role of the right cerebral hemisphere
                  in processing novel metaphoric expressions taken from poetry.
                  In two experiments, participants were presented with four
                  types of word pairs, literal, conventional metaphoric and
                  novel metaphoric expressions and unrelated word pairs, and
                  asked to perform a semantic judgment task. Two different SOAs:
                  400 and 1100ms were used. The results of both experiments
                  showed that responses to LVF/RH presented target words were
                  more accurate and faster than responses to RVF/LH target words
                  for novel metaphoric expressions, but not for other types of
                  word pairs. These results support previous research indicating
                  that during word recognition, the RH activates a broader range
                  of related meanings than the LH, including novel, nonsalient
                  meanings. The findings thus suggest that the RH may be

  abstract =     {Novel metaphoric sentences have repeatedly evoked larger N400
                  amplitudes than literal sentences, while investigations of the
                  late positive complex (LPC) have brought inconsistent results,
                  with reports of both increased and reduced amplitudes. In two
                  experiments, we examined novel metaphor comprehension in
                  Polish, using the same set of literal, novel metaphoric, and
                  anomalous sentences. The first aim of the study was to test
                  whether novel metaphors would evoke larger or smaller late
                  positivity complex (LPC) amplitudes compared to literal and
                  anomalous sentences. Some earlier studies have shown that
                  whether increased LPC amplitudes are observed or not may be
                  related to the task participants are asked to perform, with
                  explicit acceptability judgments being more likely to evoke
                  the LPC effect. The second aim of the study was, thus, to test
                  whether the observed LPC pattern would be the same across two
                  tasks, the semantic decision task (Experiment 1) and the
                  reading task (Experiment 2). Our results replicated the N400
                  effect observed in earlier studies on metaphor in both
                  experiments. Most importantly, a reduction in late positivity
                  to novel metaphors relative to anomalous sentences was found
                  in both experiments. Additionally, this difference was broadly
                  distributed over parietal sites in Experiment 1, and clearly
                  left-lateralized in Experiment 2, which might imply
                  differences in the involvement of recollection and semantic
                  processes. Overall, these results seem to indicate that both
                  conventionality and task demands modulate the LPC pattern.},

                  substrates of metaphor processing. In particular, it has been
                  suggested that the right hemisphere plays a special role in
                  the comprehension of figurative (non-literal) language, and in
                  particular metaphors. However, some studies find no evidence
                  of right hemisphere involvement in metaphor comprehension
                  (e.g. [Lee, S. S., \& Dapretto, M. (2006). Metaphorical vs.
                  literal word meanings: fMRI evidence against a selective role
                  of the right hemisphere. NeuroImage, 29, 536–544; Rapp, A. M.,

                  Neural correlates of metaphor processing. Cognitive Brain
                  Research, 20, 395–402]). We suggest that lateralization
                  differences between literal and metaphorical language may be
                  due to factors such as differences in familiarity ([Schmidt,
                  G. L., DeBuse, C. J., \& Seger, C. A. (2007). Right hemisphere
                  metaphor processing? Characterizing the lateralization of
                  semantic processes. Brain and Language, 100, 127–141]), or
                  difficulty ([Bookheimer, S. (2002). Functional MRI of
                  language: New approaches to understanding the cortical
                  organization of semantic processing. Annual Review of

                  metaphor processing. Cognitive Brain Research, 20, 395–402])
                  in addition to figurativeness. The purpose of this study was
                  to separate the effects of figurativeness, familiarity, and
                  difficulty on the recruitment of neural systems involved in
                  language, in particular right hemisphere mechanisms. This was
                  achieved by comparing neural activation using functional
                  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) between four conditions:
                  literal sentences, familiar and easy to understand metaphors,
                  unfamiliar and easy to understand metaphors, and unfamiliar
                  and difficult to understand metaphors. Metaphors recruited the
                  right insula, left temporal pole and right inferior frontal
                  gyrus in comparison with literal sentences. Familiar metaphors
                  recruited the right middle frontal gyrus when contrasted with
                  unfamiliar metaphors. Easy metaphors showed higher activation
                  in the left middle frontal gyrus as compared to difficult
                  metaphors, while difficult metaphors showed selective
                  activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus as compared to
                  easy metaphors. We conclude that the right hemisphere is
                  involved in metaphor processing and that the factors of
                  figurativeness, familiarity and difficulty are important in
                  determining neural recruitment of semantic processing.},

                  language is processed during metaphor comprehension. However,
                  it is not clear how the brain actually creates nonliteral
                  language. Therefore, the present study for the first time
                  investigates the neural correlates of metaphor production.
                  Participants completed sentences by generating novel metaphors
                  or literal synonyms during functional imaging. Responses were
                  spoken aloud in the scanner, recorded, and subsequently rated
                  for their creative quality. We found that metaphor production
                  was associated with focal activity in predominantly
                  left-hemispheric brain regions, specifically the left angular
                  gyrus, the left middle and superior frontal gyri—corresponding
                  to the left dorsomedial prefrontal (DMPFC) cortex—and the
                  posterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, brain activation in the
                  left anterior DMPFC and the right middle temporal gyrus was
                  found to linearly increase with the creative quality of
                  metaphor responses. These findings are related to
                  neuroscientific evidence on metaphor comprehension, creative
                  idea generation and episodic future thought, suggesting that
                  creating metaphors involves the flexible adaptation of
                  semantic memory to imagine and construct novel figures of
                  speech. Furthermore, the left DMPFC may exert executive
                  control to maintain strategic search and selection, thus
                  facilitating creativity of thought.},

  abstract =     {In this essay I argue that sight-oriented linguistic cues
                  within a text can encourage the reader to visualize, and I
                  examine Imagist poetry for these inducements. My analysis
                  begins with the premise that texts implicitly guide the
                  reader's imagination and that certain words automatically urge
                  a reader to image. In addition to these prompts, Imagist
                  poetry is rife with moments of “directed seeing,” explicit
                  references within the poem to the act of seeing; given the
                  implicit textual guidance provided by the poem, the poem's
                  speaker effectively instructs the reader with these sight
                  references to mentally image what the speaker “sees.”
                  Experimental research supports this notion of visual
                  prompting: when subjects are instructed to form images, the
                  otherwise low imagers of the group produce strong imagery
                  effects. The poetic speaker's de facto instructions to “see”
                  are powered by a similar, though less explicit, element of
                  prompting that promotes visual imagery in readers.},

                  visual and musical aspects with which criticism often deals by
                  comparing the subject matter and style of the poems with those
                  of paintings by Watteau and music by Debussy. It is more
                  rewarding to study similarities of basic artistic form in
                  these works about the Rococo dream world; in particular, the
                  visual and spatial imagery shared by Verlaine and Watteau
                  helps elucidate Fêtes galantes. The vague, ambiguous, and
                  shifting impressions sought by Verlaine are created visually
                  by Watteau as the latter varies sharp delineation with hazy
                  blending. The paintings tend to have either detached
                  foreground figures or a merging of figures into a misty
                  background. Verlaine uses these effects of detachment and
                  merging in virtual space, verbally rendered, and coordinates
                  them with the recurrent themes of his suite of poems. A
                  visualized pattern along a time line results as he shifts from
                  one effect to the other in individual works and in the total
                  composition. Much of the musicality of the work is thus
                  produced through visual and spatial imagery in sequence.
                  Increased understanding of Verlaine's creation of artistic
                  form suggests the need for study of the relationships between
                  this form and the contents of the poems.]},

  url =          {https://www.jstor.org/stable/1572049},
  doi =          {10.2307/1572049},
  abstract =     {[In all visual forms which carry meaning, from architecture to
                  painting, the author points out that there is a level of
                  organization which is rhetorical. The whole meaning of a work
                  of art is the sphere of iconology. The study of its forms
                  without regard to symbolic or other meaning is formal
                  analysis. The area between, where the lesser forms of
                  organization of meaning occur, is the area of visual rhetoric.
                  Rhetoric is used in its classical, verbal sense as the means
                  by which words are chosen, pitched to some diction, pointed
                  with gestures and expression, and arrayed in order to affect a
                  listener towards some end. Visual rhetoric overlaps verbal
                  rhetoric when the material it orders translates easily from
                  words to images and back, as in Renaissance and Baroque
                  painting done under the motto 'ut pictura poesis'. By far the
                  largest part of visual rhetoric has no verbal analogues and
                  is, in fact, the discovery of the non-literary art of our
                  time. The author states that the concept of the rhetoric of
                  vision puts into a coherent system our ideas of style, genres,
                  modes of representation, iconography, media, personal manner,
                  format, composition and the negation of all or any of these.
                  Visual rhetoric is the Iconography of the twentieth century.
                  /// L'auteur montre que, dans toutes les formes plastiques
                  porteuses de signification, de l'architecture à la peinture,
                  il existe un niveau d'organisation rhétorique de cette
                  signification. La signification globale d'une œuvre d'art est
                  du domaine de l'iconologie; alors que de procéder à une étude
                  des formes qu'elle présente sans la relier à une signification
                  symbolique ou autre revient à faire une analyse formelle.
                  C'est entre ces deux points de vue, là où se manifestent les
                  formes inférieures d'organisation de la signification, que se
                  place le domaine de la rhétorique visuelle. 'Rhétorique' est
                  ici employé dans son sens les plus classique et verbal, comme
                  le moyen de choisir des mots, de les adapter à un style, de
                  les mettre en relief grâce à des gestes ou à des expressions,
                  et de les arranger de façon à produire un certain effet sur
                  l'auditeur. La rhétorique visuelle dépasse la rhétorique
                  verbale lorsque ce qu'elle ordonnance passe facilement des
                  mots aux images et vice versa, comme c'est le cas de la
                  peinture de la Renaissance et de l'époque Baroque qui
                  suivirent la devise 'ut pictura poesis'. En grande partie, il
                  n'est rien de comparable à la rhétorique visuelle, laquelle
                  consiste, de fait, en la découverte de l'art non-littéraire de
                  notre époque. L'auteur pense que le concept de la rhétorique
                  de la vision permet de rassembler dans un système cohérent nos
                  idées de style, genres, modes de représentation, iconographie,
                  moyens, manière personnelle, format, composition, ainsi que la
                  négation de tout ou partie de ces éléments. La rhétorique
                  visuelle est l'iconographie du vingtième siècle.]},

                  disinterested poetic voice. While his early published

                  prominent examples of extremely short poetic forms in world
                  literature. Their brevity matters, for the drastic reduction
                  in space bespeaks the poets' fundamental questioning of what
                  poetry really is: there is no room to be anything but
                  "poetic." For the imagists, this meant fresh imagery as a
                  means of cognitive exploration. Preoccupied with "newness,"
                  however, they tended to disregard the importance of the "old"
                  as a necessary means to set off novelty, an oversight that led
                  to their eventual demise. Haiku, on the other hand, is a genre
                  of long standing, firmly rooted in tradition. The key to its
                  unabated vigor lies in Bashō's keen awareness of the utility
                  of the past in undertaking an avant-garde enterprise, which he
                  summed up in his famous adage "fueki-ryūkō," which can be
                  roughly translated as "permanence and change." My essay

  abstract =     {[This article considers the evolution of Hulme's thought from
                  his 'Lecture on Modern Poetry' to 'Romanticism and
                  Classicism', including the development of his belief in poetry
                  as a visual language, why he defines the 'aesthetic emotion'
                  in such a limited way, and why he links these ideas to the
                  Classicism of Action Française. What it demonstrates is that
                  William James's description of the distinction between
                  Romantic and Classical art in Principles of Psychology played
                  a part in helping Hulme to reduce Bergson's concept of
                  'aesthetic emotion' to sensation, and to see such effects as
                  pertaining to Classical, rather than Romantic art. However,
                  Hulme failed to realise that Bergson's ideas on art were in
                  fact incompatible with William James's. This incompatibility
                  caused tensions between the theory and practice of the Imagist
                  movement inspired by Hulme's ideas. The conflict was caused
                  partly by James's denial of the uniqueness of aesthetic
                  emotion, and partly because, in reducing the aesthetic emotion
                  to sensation, he negates the importance of memory and
                  association to the image's aesthetic effect, which is by its
                  very nature temporal in manifestation. The piece concludes by
                  demonstrating how the poem 'Hermes of the Ways', by H.D., does
                  not concord with Pound's doctrine of image as an 'intellectual
                  and emotional complex in an instant of time', and needs memory
                  and association to unravel if the image is to work. This
                  critique demonstrates the divergence between genuine Imagist
                  practice and William James's prioritisation of immediate
                  sensation, which Hulme had communicated to Imagist theory.]},

                  vividness, 3 grades or intensities of visual imagery have been
                  discriminated: Pictures of things or typographical images,
                  distinct images filled with substance, and richer images. They

                  intrude upon the conscious of real space, such that sensible
                  ideas become sensation without any material alteration of
                  character and content. Images seem larger when projected on a
                  distant screen, and smaller when projected on a nearer one. In
                  dreams, objects appear to be the size of real objects, and do
                  not appear as images, but as real things. A number of factors

  abstract =     {In this lively, personal book, Robert Scholes intervenes in
                  ongoing discussions about modernism in the arts during the
                  crucial half-century from 1895 to 1945. While critics of and
                  apologists for modernism have defined modern art and
                  literature in terms of binary oppositions—high/low, old/new,
                  hard/soft, poetry/rhetoric—Scholes contends that these
                  distinctions are in fact confused and misleading. Such
                  oppositions are instances of “paradoxy”—an apparent clarity
                  that covers real confusion.Closely examining specific literary
                  texts, drawings, critical writings, and memoirs, Scholes seeks
                  to complicate the neat polar oppositions attributed to
                  modernism. He argues for the rehabilitation of works in the
                  middle ground that have been trivialized in previous
                  evaluations, and he fights orthodoxy with such paradoxes as
                  “durable fluff,” “formulaic creativity,” and “iridescent
                  mediocrity.” The book reconsiders major figures like James
                  Joyce while underscoring the value of minor figures and
                  addressing new attention to others rarely studied. It includes
                  twenty-two illustrations of the artworks discussed. Filled
                  with the observations of a personable and witty guide, this is
                  a book that opens up for a reader’s delight the rich cultural
                  terrain of modernism.},

  annotation = {This book offers a comprehensive reassessment of ekphrasis: the verbal representation of visual art. Ekphrasis has been traditionally regarded as a form of paragone (competition) between word and image. This interdisciplinary collection of essays seeks to complicate this critical paradigm and proposes a more reciprocal model of ekphrasis that involves an encounter or exchange between visual and textual cultures. This critical and theoretical shift demands a new form of ekphrastic poetics, which is less concerned with representational and institutional struggles, and more concerned with ideas of ethics, affect and intersubjectivity. Ekphrastic encounters brings together leading scholars working in the field of word-and-image studies and offers a fresh exploration of ekphrastic texts from the Renaissance to the present day. Taken together, the chapters establish a new set of theoretical frameworks for exploring the ekphrastic encounter. -- Klappentext Introduction: from paragone to encounter - David Kennedy and Richard MeekPart I: Early modern encounters 1 'Lamentable objects': ekphrasis and historical materiality in Shakespeare's The Rape of Lucrece - Rachel Eisendrath2 'Fabulously counterfeit': ekphrastic encounters in Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy - Richard Meek3 'Art indeed is long, but life is short': ekphrasis and mortality in Andrew Marvell - Keith McDonald 4 'The Painter has made a finer Story than the Poet': Jonathan Richardson's ekphrastic 'Dissertation' on Poussin's Tancred and Erminia - Jason LawrencePart II: Nineteenth-century encounters 5 Blind spots of narration?

                  principal features. In that respect, fragmentation, disunity,
                  relativity of things, break with tradition, as well as the
                  depiction of life’s disorder, are disputed and seen as

                  ideologies.Aesthetics and Ideology of D. H. Lawrence, Virginia

                  discussion and revision of some fixed concepts related to
                  Modernism, through individual authors and their major works to
                  the conclusion where the main findings are summarized and

                  general, Aesthetics and Ideology of D. H. Lawrence, Virginia
                  Woolf and T. S. Eliot presents a somewhat different view on
                  the authors it deals with. They are not only seen as opponents
                  of established religious, political, and social views, but to
                  a certain extent as their perpetrators. This duality
                  concerning their stances is reconciled by their insisting on

  abstract =     {The spontaneous use of imagery and its relationship to free
                  verbal recall were investigated. Community college students
                  read a 2,100-word story under one of three sets of
                  instructions and then recalled the story and reported their
                  images immediately and 48 hours later. A new methodology for
                  classifying imagery reports was developed. Results indicated
                  that separate categories of imagery reports and verbal recalls
                  were not highly correlated. Principal components analysis
                  yielded factors predominated by imagery variables. Further,
                  whereas total verbal recall declined over the retention
                  interval (i.e., forgetting), imagery did not. Experimental
                  instructions to readers designed to manipulate processing
                  depth in an externally valid fashion did not result in
                  significant differences in imagery reporting and recall,
                  suggesting that a strict levels of processing view may be
                  untenable for ecologically valid reading situations. Other
                  results indicated that a significant relationship existed
                  between imaging a story segment and the story grammar
                  macro-structure of that segment, and that imagery of the
                  climactic event was the most common. This study contributes to
                  a series of studies using various texts and methodologies that
                  suggest that imagery is a distinctive aspect of reading,
                  viable for study in its own right.},

                  discuss two issues central to any theoretical inquiry into
                  mental imagery: embodiment and consciousness. I do so against
                  the backdrop of second-generation cognitive science, more
                  specifically the increasingly popular research framework of
                  embodied cognition, and I consider two caveats attached to its
                  current exploitation in narrative theory. In the second part,
                  I attempt to cast new light on readerly mental imagery by
                  offering a typology of what I propose to be its four basic
                  varieties. The typology is grounded in the framework of
                  embodied cognition and it is largely compatible with key
                  neuroscientific and other experimental evidence produced
                  within the framework. For each imagery variety, I make some
                  elementary suggestions as to how it may typically be cued by
                  distinct narrative strategies.},

  abstract =     {Edited by Anna Balakian, this volume marks the first attempt
                  to discuss Symbolism in a full range of the literatures
                  written in the European languages. The scope of these
                  analyses, which explore Latin America, Scandinavia, Russia,
                  Poland, Hungary, Serbia, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria as well
                  as West European literatures, continues to make the volume a
                  valuable reference today. As René Wellek suggests in his
                  historiographic contribution, the fifty-one contributors not
                  only make us think afresh about individual authors who are
                  giants, but also draw us to reassess schools and
                  movements in their local as well as international contexts.
                  Reviewers comment that this copious and intelligently
                  structured anthology, divided into eight parts, traces the
                  conceptual bases and emergence of an international Symbolist
                  movement, showing the spread of Symbolism to other national
                  literatures from French sources, as well as the symbiotic
                  transformations of Symbolism through appropriation and
                  amalgamation with local literary trends. Several chapters deal
                  with the relationships between literature and the other arts,
                  pointing to Symbolism at work in painting, music, and theatre.
                  Other chapters on the psychological aspects of the Symbolist
                  method connect in interesting ways to a vision of metaphor and
                  myth as virtually musical notation and an experimental
                  emphasis on the play afforded by gaps between words. The
                  volume is a major contribution to the most
                  significant exponents and essential themes of
                  Symbolism. The theoretical, historical, and typological
                  sections of the volume help explain why the impact of this
                  important movement of the fin-de-siècle is still felt today.},

                  Ezra Pound's concern." The sixty-six pieces in Pound's
                  "Selected Prose 1909-1965" are arranged thematically, and
                  while they are organized chronologically within several

                  concerned with "Civilization, Money and History." This section
                  contains such essential texts as the "ABC of Economics" and
                  "What is Money For?" as well as two essays - "Gold and Work"

                  literature of interpretative criticism -contains the Clark
                  Lectures delivered at Cambridge University in 1946. Its theme
                  is poetic imagery, not only in its stricter sense of simile,
                  metaphor and image, but in the wider application of the term,
                  by which every good poem is itself a total image made up of a
                  multiplicity of component images. The book is therefore more
                  than an academic study of one aspect of poetic material and
                  technique: it is an investigation into the nature of poetry
                  itself, taking as its clue the belief, as old as Aristotle,
                  that the power of image-making is the one sure sign of poetic
                  genius. Beneath all the manifestations of the poetic image,
                  Mr. Day Lewis traces one principle at work - the ' abiding
                  impulse in every human being to seek order and harmony behind
                  the manifold and the changing'.},

  abstract =     {In May 1906, the Atlantic Monthly commented that Americans
                  live not merely in an age of things, but under the tyranny of
                  them, and that in our relentless effort to sell, purchase, and
                  accumulate things, we do not possess them as much as they
                  possess us. For Bill Brown, the tale of that possession is
                  something stranger than the history of a culture of
                  consumption. It is the story of Americans using things to
                  think about themselves. Brown's captivating new study explores
                  the roots of modern America's fascination with things and the
                  problem that objects posed for American literature at the turn
                  of the century. This was an era when the invention,
                  production, distribution, and consumption of things suddenly
                  came to define a national culture. Brown shows how crucial
                  novels of the time made things not a solution to problems, but
                  problems in their own right. Writers such as Mark Twain, Frank
                  Norris, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Henry James ask why and how we
                  use objects to make meaning, to make or remake ourselves, to
                  organize our anxieties and affections, to sublimate our fears,
                  and to shape our wildest dreams. Offering a remarkably new way
                  to think about materialism, A Sense of Things will be
                  essential reading for anyone interested in American literature
                  and culture.},

  abstract =     {The System of Objects is a tour de force--a theoretical
                  letter-in-a-bottle tossed into the ocean in 1968, which
                  brilliantly communicates to us all the live ideas of the day.
                  Pressing Freudian and Saussurean categories into the service
                  of a basically Marxist perspective, The System of Objects
                  offers a cultural critique of the commodity in consumer
                  society. Baudrillard classifies the everyday objects of the
                  "new technical order" as functional, nonfunctional and
                  metafunctional. He contrasts "modern" and "traditional"
                  functional objects, subjecting home furnishing and interior
                  design to a celebrated semiological analysis. His treatment of
                  nonfunctional or "marginal" objects focuses on antiques and
                  the psychology of collecting, while the metafunctional
                  category extends to the useless, the aberrant and even the
                  "schizofunctional." Finally, Baudrillard deals at length with
                  the implications of credit and advertising for the
                  commodification of everyday life. The System of Objects is a
                  tour de force of the materialist semiotics of the early
                  Baudrillard, who emerges in retrospect as something of a
                  lightning rod for all the live ideas of the day: Bataille's
                  political economy of "expenditure" and Mauss's theory of the
                  gift; Reisman's lonely crowd and the "technological society"
                  of Jacques Ellul; the structuralism of Roland Barthes in The
                  System of Fashion; Henri Lefebvre's work on the social
                  construction of space; and last, but not least, Guy Debord's
                  situationist critique of the spectacle.},

                  comprehend and to produce words, sentences,numbers and objects
                  (or pictures of them). The unique contribution of the field of
                  cognitive neuropsychology is the investigation of these
                  representations and processes in individuals who have
                  sustained selective brain damage. Indeed, studies of such
                  individuals provide a window into the mental system and allow
                  us to explore the functional architecture that is necessary
                  and sufficient for cognition. This special issue of Cognitive
                  Neuropsychology is a collection of papers that exemplifies
                  this type of cognitive neuropsychology research. The special
                  issue is designed to honour and pay tribute to Eleanor M.

                  individuals with cognitive impairment following brain damage.

                  concerning behavioural and neural mechanisms mediating

                  these focus on language, with the emphasis of the first on
                  single word recognition and the second on processes that are
                  invoked beyond the single word level. Conceptual and semantic
                  processes are covered in a third section and the final section
                  is concerned with issues related to more peripheral processes,
                  which, when impaired, give rise to alexia, agnosia and/or

                  Michel Foucault l'étudie, à partir du XVIIe siècle, dans les
                  trois domaines où le langage classique - qui s'identifiait au
                  Discours - avait le privilège de pouvoir représenter l'ordre

                  gender, and sexuality. The poet H.D. (1886-1961) was in
                  psychoanalysis with Sigmund Freud in Vienna during the spring
                  of 1933 and again in the fall of 1934. She visited him daily
                  at his study at 19 Berggasse, while outside Nazi thugs and
                  militia bullied their way through the streets. Freud was old,
                  and fragile. H.D. was forty-six and despairing of her writing
                  life, which seemed to have reached a dead end, for all her
                  success. Her sessions with Freud proved to be the point of
                  transition, the funnel into which were poured her memories of
                  the past and associations in the presentand from which she
                  emerged reborn. H.D. came to Freud at the urging of her
                  companion, the novelist Bryher (1884-1983), the daughter of a
                  wealthy British shipping magnate. Freud welcomed H.D. as a
                  creative spirit whose work he respected, but he did ask her
                  not to prepare for their sessions, write about them in her
                  journal, or talk about them with her friends, especially
                  Bryher, who remained home in England. H.D.'s letters from
                  Vienna filled the gap. Breezy, informal, irreverent, vibrant
                  with detail, they revolve around her hours with Freud, making
                  her correspondence unique in the spectrum of reminiscences,
                  journals, memoirs, and biographies swirling around the legacy
                  of the "Professor" and the movement he founded. The volume
                  includes H.D. and Bryher's letters, as well as letters by
                  Freud to H.D. and Bryher, most of them published for the first
                  time. In addition, the book includes H.D. and Bryher's letters
                  to and from Havelock Ellis, Kenneth MacPherson, Robert
                  McAlmon, Ezra Pound, and Anna Freud, among others. Fully

  abstract =     {A classic of American literature, now with a new introduction
                  by iconic author and psychotherapist Adam Phillips. “My
                  bat-like thought-wings would beat painfully in that sudden
                  searchlight,” H.D. writes in Tribute to Freud, her moving
                  memoir. Compelled by historical as well as personal crises,
                  H.D. underwent therapy with Freud during 1933–34, as the
                  streets of Vienna were littered with tokens dropped like
                  confetti on the city stating “Hitler gives work,” “Hitler
                  gives bread.” Having endured World War I, she was now
                  gathering her resources to face the cataclysm she knew was
                  approaching. The first part of the book, “Writing on the
                  Wall,” was composed some ten years after H.D.’s stay in
                  Vienna; the second part, “Advent,” is a journal she kept
                  during her analysis. Revealed here in the poet’s crystal
                  shard-like words and in Freud’s own letters (which comprise an
                  appendix) is a remarkably tender and human portrait of the
                  legendary Doctor in the twilight of his life. Time double
                  backs on itself, mingling past, present, and future in a
                  visionary weave of dream, memory, and reflections.},

                  alive in every fibre, intellectually capable and skilful in
                  essential logic, and then morally very honest.'These comments
                  by D. H. Lawrence are as close a description as any of himself

                  writing encompasses an enormous variety of subjects, from

  abstract =     {The field of language planning (LP) has largely ignored
                  planned languages. Of classic descriptions of LP processes,
                  only Tauli (preceded by Wüster) suggests that planned
                  languages (what Wüster calls Plansprache) might bear on LP
                  theory and practice. If LP aims “to modify the linguistic
                  behaviour of some community for some reason,” as Kaplan and
                  Baldauf put it, creating a language de novo is little
                  different. Language policy and planning are increasingly seen
                  as more local and less official, and occasionally more
                  international and cosmopolitan. Zamenhof’s work on Esperanto
                  provides extensive material, little studied, documenting the
                  formation of the language and linking it particularly to
                  issues of supranational LP. Defining LP decision-making,
                  Kaplan \& Baldauf begin with context and target population.
                  Zamenhof’s Esperanto came shortly before Ben-Yehuda’s revived
                  Hebrew. His target community was (mostly) the world’s educated
                  elite; Ben-Yehuda’s was worldwide Jewry. Both planners were
                  driven not by linguistic interest but by sociopolitical
                  ideology rooted in reaction to antiSemitism and imbued with
                  the idea of progress. Their territories had no boundaries, but
                  were not imaginary. Function mattered as much as form
                  (Haugen’s terms), status as much as corpus. For Zamenhof,
                  status planning involved emphasis on Esperanto’s ownership by
                  its community – a collective planning process embracing all
                  speakers (cf. Hebrew). Corpus planning included a standardized
                  European semantics, lexical selectivity based not simply on
                  standardization but on representation, and the development of
                  written, and literary, style. Esperanto was successful as

  abstract =     {One of the first tasks faced by Zamenhof, the inventor of
                  Esperanto (1887), was establishing its status as a living
                  language, achieved in part by teaching the language to others,
                  in part by translation and literary creation, and in part by
                  forming a community of users. One of the earliest learners,
                  Leo Tolstoy, emphasized its ease of learning, and both the
                  early history of the language and contemporary experience show
                  that the receptive and productive skills entailed in learning
                  the language are unusually mutually reinforcing. In formal
                  language-learning situations, students are able to reach an
                  acceptable level of proficiency relatively quickly, allowing
                  them to put the language to practical use. They are also able
                  to learn on their own. Ease of learning builds confidence, so
                  that Esperanto constitutes a good introduction to language
                  study in general, even though the language is more complex
                  linguistically than it may appear at first sight. The language
                  also helps the learning of cultural sensitivity. In recent
                  years, electronic aids to teaching and learning have
                  proliferated and there are many resources available to the
                  teacher and learner.},

                  reconstructing AN vectors not seen in training. A small
                  post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the
                  model-generated AN vector is not similar to the
                  corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the
                  latter. We show moreover that our approach provides two novel
                  ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its
                  representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both
                  outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task.},

                  smell and touch, to comprehend the sensorial information in
                  language is a straightforward task for humans by using
                  commonsense knowledge. With this in mind, a lexicon
                  associating words with senses would be crucial for the
                  computational tasks aiming at interpretation of language.
                  However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic
                  attempt in the literature to build such a resource. In this
                  paper, we present a sensorial lexicon that associates English
                  words with senses. To obtain this resource, we apply a
                  computational method based on bootstrapping and corpus
                  statistics. The quality of the resulting lexicon is evaluated
                  with a gold standard created via crowdsourcing. The results
                  show that a simple classifier relying on the lexicon
                  outperforms two baselines on a sensory classification task,
                  both at word and sentence level, and confirm the soundness of
                  the proposed approach for the construction of the lexicon and
                  the usefulness of the resource for computational
                  applications.},

                  environment and share a common understanding of the world that
                  we perceive through our sensory organs. Therefore, each
                  language might contain a great amount of sensorial elements to
                  express the perceptions both in literal and ﬁgurative usage.
                  To tackle the semantics of ﬁgurative language, several
                  conceptual properties such as concreteness or imegeability are
                  utilized. However, there is no attempt in the literature to
                  analyze and beneﬁt from the sensorial elements for ﬁgurative
                  language processing. In this paper, we investigate the impact
                  of sensorial features on metaphor identiﬁcation. We utilize an
                  existing lexicon associating English words to sensorial
                  modalities and propose a novel technique to automatically
                  discover these associations from a dependency-parsed corpus.
                  In our experiments, we measure the contribution of the
                  sensorial features to the metaphor identiﬁcation task with
                  respect to a state of the art model. The results demonstrate
                  that sensorial features yield better performance and show good
                  generalization properties.},

  abstract =     {In "Iconology," W. J. T. Mitchell asked what images are, how
                  they differ from words, and why these questions have been such
                  a source of contention for centuries. In this companion volume
                  to "Iconology," he extends his investigation to pictures--the
                  concrete, representational objects in which images appear.
                  Although we have thousands of words about pictures, Mitchell
                  notes that we do not yet have a satisfactory theory of them.
                  What we have is a variety of disciplines--semiotics,
                  philosophical inquiries into representation, new departures in
                  art history, studies in mass media--that attempt to converge
                  on the problem of pictorial representation and visual culture.
                  Identifying the problems inherent in the attempt to master
                  visual representation with verbal discourse, Mitchell proposes
                  instead to "picture theory." He looks at the way pictures
                  function in theories about culture, consciousness, and
                  representation, and at theory itself as a form of picturing.
                  What precisely, he asks, are pictures (and theories about
                  pictures) doing "now," in the late twentieth century, when the
                  power of the visual is said to be greater than ever before,
                  and the "pictorial turn" supplants the "linguistic turn" in
                  the study of culture?Focusing on Spike Lee's "Do the Right
                  Thing," Oliver Stone's "JFK," and television coverage of the
                  Gulf War, he examines the capacity of visual images to awaken
                  or stifle public debate, collective emotion, and political
                  violence. An "applied iconology, " this book by one of
                  America's leading theorists of visual representation offers an
                  immensely rich and suggestive account of the interplay between
                  the visible and the readable across the culture, from
                  literature to visualart to the mass media.},

  shorttitle =   {What {{Do Pictures Want}}?},
  abstract =     {Why do we have such extraordinarily powerful responses toward
                  the images and pictures we see in everyday life? Why do we
                  behave as if pictures were alive, possessing the power to
                  influence us, to demand things from us, to persuade us, seduce
                  us, or even lead us astray? According to W. J. T. Mitchell, we
                  need to reckon with images not just as inert objects that
                  convey meaning but as animated beings with desires, needs,
                  appetites, demands, and drives of their own. What Do Pictures
                  Want? explores this idea and highlights Mitchell's innovative
                  and profoundly influential thinking on picture theory and the
                  lives and loves of images. Ranging across the visual arts,
                  literature, and mass media, Mitchell applies
                  characteristically brilliant and wry analyses to Byzantine
                  icons and cyberpunk films, racial stereotypes and public
                  monuments, ancient idols and modern clones, offensive images
                  and found objects, American photography and aboriginal
                  painting. Opening new vistas in iconology and the emergent
                  field of visual culture, he also considers the importance of
                  Dolly the Sheep—who, as a clone, fulfills the ancient dream of
                  creating a living image—and the destruction of the World Trade
                  Center on 9/11, which, among other things, signifies a new and
                  virulent form of iconoclasm. What Do Pictures Want? offers an
                  immensely rich and suggestive account of the interplay between
                  the visible and the readable. A work by one of our leading
                  theorists of visual representation, it will be a touchstone
                  for art historians, literary critics, anthropologists, and
                  philosophers alike. “A treasury of episodes—generally
                  overlooked by art history and visual studies—that turn on
                  images that ‘walk by themselves’ and exert their own power
                  over the living.”—Norman Bryson, Artforum},

  abstract =     {Almost thirty years ago, W. J. T. Mitchell’s Iconology helped
                  launch the interdisciplinary study of visual media, now a
                  central feature of the humanities. Along with his subsequent
                  Picture Theory and What Do Pictures Want?, Mitchell’s
                  now-classic work introduced such ideas as the pictorial turn,
                  the image/picture distinction, the metapicture, and the
                  biopicture. These key concepts imply an approach to images as
                  true objects of investigation—an “image science.” Continuing
                  with this influential line of thought, Image Science gathers
                  Mitchell’s most recent essays on media aesthetics, visual
                  culture, and artistic symbolism. The chapters delve into such
                  topics as the physics and biology of images, digital
                  photography and realism, architecture and new media, and the
                  occupation of space in contemporary popular uprisings. The
                  book looks both backward at the emergence of iconology as a
                  field and forward toward what might be possible if image
                  science can indeed approach pictures the same way that
                  empirical sciences approach natural phenomena. Essential for
                  those involved with any aspect of visual media, Image Science
                  is a brilliant call for a method of studying images that
                  overcomes the “two-culture split” between the natural and
                  human sciences.},

  abstract =     {Literary Realism and the Ekphrastic Tradition examines
                  representative texts and the theories of realism upon which
                  they are based. It studies the foundations of these theories
                  in the philosophies of language contemporaneous with them.
                  Beginning with Adamicism, Mack Smith looks at the way
                  humanist, rationalist, empiricist, Kantian, positivist, and
                  poststructuralist theories of language are textually
                  dramatized. He considers the cultural and personal influences
                  that affect historical notions of realism and reality. He also
                  demonstrates the rhetorical basis of realism by considering a
                  mimetic device used by novelists in rendering a faithful
                  version of reality\&amp;—ekphrasis, the narrative description
                  of a work of art. Smith seeks a middle ground between the
                  extremes of theory and interpretation, discourse and reality,
                  and textualism and history, thus making an important
                  contribution to the revaluation of literary studies.},

  abstract =     {This volume, the twenty-second in the acclaimed Collected
                  Works of Northrop Frye series, presents Frye's most
                  influential work, Anatomy of Criticism (1957). In four stylish
                  and sweeping essays, Frye attempts to formulate an overall
                  view of the scope, principles, and techniques of literary
                  criticism and the conventions of literature - its modes,
                  symbols, archetypes, and genres. He makes the case for
                  criticism as a legitimate and structured science, a science
                  that he would go on to wield with great influence over the
                  course of his distinguished career. Robert D. Denham's
                  introduction to this edition examines the book's genesis, its
                  initial reception, and its relation to Frye's other works,
                  particularly Fearful Symmetry (Volume 14 in the series). He
                  highlights the diagrammatic way of thinking that characterizes
                  Frye's brand of structuralism and explores the meaning of the
                  word 'anatomy.' Denham also provides context for the work,
                  considering the critical tradition out of which it emerged, as
                  well as how it relates to some of the movements that appeared
                  after the waning of structuralism. A key volume in the
                  Collected Works series, this annotated and expertly introduced
                  edition of Anatomy of Criticism will be sure to satisfy Frye's
                  many admirers.},

                  fascism, Futurist aesthetics were an important influence on
                  her fiction. In her 1932 novel To the North, she lampooned and
                  condemned British fascism's borrowed Italian aesthetics, but
                  in 1935's The House in Paris, Bowen took up some of the
                  techniques of the Futurist painters, adapting them in order to
                  draw attention to the situation of fascism's potential
                  victims. What changed from one novel to the next was the tone
                  and urgency of her critique, and the focus of her Futurist
                  inquiry, which switched from Marinetti/Mussolini's “speed”
                  trajectory to the “noctambulist” temporal and spatial

                  the cultural arts the lexicon of early modernism reigns
                  supreme. This essay contends that a critical condition for the
                  possibility of many of the turn of the century modernist
                  movements in the arts can be found in exchange of instruments,
                  concepts, and media of representation between the sciences and
                  the arts. One route of interaction came through physiological
                  aesthetics, the attempt to ‘elucidate physiologically the
                  nature of our Aesthetic feelings’ and explain how works of art
                  achieve their effects. Physiological aesthetics provided the
                  terms for new formalist languages of art and criticism, and in
                  some instances suggested optimistic, even utopian,
                  possibilities for art to remake human individuals and

                  poet and central authority in the field modern verse,
                  throughout much of the twentieth century Amy Lowell has been
                  known simply as the woman who stole control of the
                  quintessential school of modern poetry—Imagism —from the

                  for and controversial role of poetry anthologies in the
                  modernist period, I show that the struggle between Pound and
                  Lowell was more than a simple personality conflict. It was
                  truly a battle over the central question of what modernism
                  ought to be: in Pound's estimation, a small and hierarchized
                  sliver of literary elite vying for central control over
                  literary production and its audience or, in Lowell's project,
                  a collective approach to literature in which authors work

  abstract =     {Although much attention has recently been given to modern
                  little magazines, critics largely have failed to consider how
                  the bibliographical elements of these magazines were
                  instrumental in their production and dissemination of poetic
                  modernism. Focusing on "Poetry": A Magazine of Verse, this
                  article argues for the importance of these elements, showing
                  how format leads to form. It contends that "Poetry" extended
                  the poetic presentation already at work in middlebrow mass
                  circulation magazines, turning the poem into an aesthetic
                  object for contemplation isolated on the page and framed by a
                  border of white space. Subsequently this promoted a
                  consolidation of genre and an opening up of form that pitted
                  "poetry" against popular "verse." Finally, this article shows
                  that these formal and generic innovations uniquely positioned
                  "Poetry" to showcase Imagism(e) and offers a re-reading of one
                  of its most lasting examples, Pound's "In a Station of the

  abstract =     {Pound's conversion from Imagism to Vorticism in 1913-1914 has
                  been generally considered a turning-point in his career, and
                  recent studies have stressed the importance of Vorticism for a
                  true understanding of the Cantos. Pound's criticism of the
                  "static image" has been rightly emphasized. However, Futurism
                  which publicized the concept and practice of dynamism has been
                  ignored or quickly passed over as a revolutionary movement
                  which made an impact on Pound. Even recently literary
                  historiography has surprisingly accepted Pound's and Wyndham
                  Lewis's antifuturistic statements without questioning them.
                  Yet there is ample evidence that Marinetti's manifestos and
                  his London performances were crucial in Pound's militant
                  transformation. This essay, after briefly describing the
                  Futurists' sensational impression on London, and following
                  their echoes inside the English avant-garde (see sections I,
                  II and III), traces the presence of Futurist tenets in Pound's
                  pamphleteerings of 1913 and 1914 and in his "Contemporania"
                  poems. It comments on the Futurist-inspired concept of
                  Vorticism (see section IV) and on the historical reasons which
                  brought about a local avant-garde caught between revolution
                  and reaction (see section V and VI). One should no longer see
                  Futurism through the distorted lens of Vorticism. Though by no
                  means the only influence on Pound in 1913-1914, Futurism
                  appears to have been momentous in his development.},

  abstract =     {The emergence of Gabriel Preil's Hebrew Modernism in the New
                  York of the thirties was totally unexpected. His Imagistic
                  free verse seemed a bold departure from the romantic norms of
                  American Hebrew verse, and even from those dominating the
                  "Modernistic" mainstream in Eretz Israel. Since this deviation
                  has since become the governing norm of Israeli "young" poetry
                  (the "State generation" of the fifties and sixties), Preil's
                  innovations and their sources have often been dwelt upon by
                  reviewers and critics. As critical consensus has it, his
                  Modernistic tendencies were inspired, naturally enough, by
                  American Modern verse, particularly of the Imagistic variety.
                  That Preil actually had had recourse to another Modernistic
                  source, one closer to home--American Yiddish verse--was
                  altogether overlooked or ignored. The present study proceeds
                  from the assumption that locating Preil's Yiddish models could
                  shed some light on the sources of his new Hebrew style. It
                  suggests that a correlation may exist between his stylistic
                  breakthrough and his active literary bilingualism.
                  Consequently, his Yiddish connections, poetical as well as
                  personal, are explored and their impact is placed in the
                  perspective of the problematic evolution of Modernistic style
                  in Hebrew letters.},

                  modernism, its many contradictions, and its troubled place in
                  our public culture. Lawrence Rainey, widely known for his
                  contributions to the debates on modernism, looks beyond the
                  well-examined themes and innovative forms of the movement,
                  asking instead where modernism was produced and how it was
                  transmitted to particular audiences. Delving into previously
                  unexamined primary materials, the author tells new and
                  startling stories about five major modernist figures - James
                  Joyce, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, H.D., and F. T. Marinetti -
                  whose individual tales offer fresh perspectives on the larger
                  story of modernism itself. The book ranges in time from the
                  formation of Imagism in 1912 to the slow dissolution of
                  modernism during the late 1930s.},

  abstract =     {ABSTRACT: This article attempts to reinstate the inherent
                  rigor of “image” as a literary term by addressing the
                  theoretical issues related to the image that W. J. T. Mitchell
                  discusses in his encyclopedia entry and his articles on the
                  concept. The image is usually considered an overly
                  psychological concept that lacks the rigor of rhetorical
                  devices such as metaphor. This article clarifies the
                  relationship between the image and metaphor by arguing that,
                  while an image may not be immediately considered a metaphor, a
                  metaphor may be thought of as a composite and relational
                  proposition-image. It underscores the futility of insisting on
                  the concrete sensual (or visual) aspect of the image, arguing
                  that, before any sensual attribution, the image must primarily
                  be thought of as a reference or picture, which may at times be
                  obscure, indefinite, or even empty. It also raises some
                  objections to the conceptualization of the mental picture as
                  private by arguing that the word on which the mental image is
                  based cannot be less private or “mental.”},

                  have been discussed often over the past thousand years.
                  However, this issue could not be addressed rigorously until
                  late in the 20th century. Initial empirical findings spurred a
                  debate about the heterogeneity of mental representation: Is
                  all information stored in propositional, language-like,
                  symbolic internal representations, or can humans use at least
                  two different types of representations (and possibly many
                  more)? Here, in historical context, we describe recent
                  evidence that humans do not always rely on propositional
                  internal representations but, instead, can also rely on at
                  least one other format: depictive representation. We propose
                  that the debate should now move on to characterizing all of
                  the different forms of human mental representation.},

  shorttitle =   {Green},
  abstract =     {In this beautiful and richly illustrated book, the acclaimed
                  author of Blue and Black presents a fascinating and revealing
                  history of the color green in European societies from
                  prehistoric times to today. Examining the evolving place of
                  green in art, clothes, literature, religion, science, and
                  everyday life, Michel Pastoureau traces how culture has
                  profoundly changed the perception and meaning of the color
                  over millennia—and how we misread cultural, social, and art
                  history when we assume that colors have always signified what
                  they do today.Filled with entertaining and enlightening
                  anecdotes, Green shows that the color has been ambivalent: a
                  symbol of life, luck, and hope, but also disorder, greed,
                  poison, and the devil. Chemically unstable, green pigments
                  were long difficult to produce and even harder to fix. Not
                  surprisingly, the color has been associated with all that is
                  changeable and fleeting: childhood, love, and money. Only in
                  the Romantic period did green definitively become the color of
                  nature. Pastoureau also explains why the color was connected
                  with the Roman emperor Nero, how it became the color of Islam,
                  why Goethe believed it was the color of the middle class, why
                  some nineteenth-century scholars speculated that the ancient
                  Greeks couldn’t see green, and how the color was denigrated by
                  Kandinsky and the Bauhaus. More broadly, Green demonstrates
                  that the history of the color is, to a large degree, one of
                  dramatic reversal: long absent, ignored, or rejected, green
                  today has become a ubiquitous and soothing presence as the
                  symbol of environmental causes and the mission to save the
                  planet.With its striking design and compelling text, Green
                  will delight anyone who is interested in history, culture,
                  art, fashion, or media.},

                  the other shades of our world in its all-encompassing
                  presence. The blues of Blue Mythologies include those present
                  in the world's religions, eggs, science, slavery, gender, sex,
                  art, the literary past, and contemporary film. Carol Mavor's
                  engaging and elegiac readings in this beautifully illustrated
                  book take the reader from the blue of a newborn baby's eyes to
                  Giotto's frescoes at Padua, and from the films of Derek Jarman
                  and Krzysztof Kiéslowski to the islands of Venice and Aran. In
                  each example Mavor unpicks meaning both above and below the
                  surface of culture. In an echo of Roland Barthes's essays in
                  Mythologies, blue is unleashed as our most familiar and most
                  paradoxical color. At once historical, sociological, literary,
                  and visual, Blue Mythologies gives us a fresh and

                  colors, blue and green have the greatest emotional range. Sad
                  reds and melancholy yellows are difficult to turn up. Among
                  the ancient elements, blue occurs everywhere: in ice and
                  water, in the flame as purely as in the flower, overhead and
                  inside caves, covering fruit and oozing out of clay. Although
                  green enlivens the earth and mixes in the ocean, and we find
                  it, copperish, in fire; green air, green skies, are rare. Gray
                  and brown and widely distributed, but there are no joyful
                  swatches of either, or any of exuberant black, sullen pink, or
                  acquiescent orange. Blue is therefore most suitable as the
                  color of interior life. Whether slick light sharp high bright
                  thin quick sour new and cool or low deep sweet dark soft slow
                  smooth heavy old and warm: blue moves easily among them all,

It contends that yellow functions during this period primarily as a color of stigma and scandal.Yellow stigmatization has had a long history: it goes back to the Middle Ages when Jews and prostitutes were forced to wear yellow signs to emphasize their marginal status. Although scholars have commented on these associations in particular contexts, Sabine Doran offers the first overarching account of how yellow connects disparate cultural phenomena, such as turn-of-the-century decadence (the "yellow nineties"), the rise of mass media ("yellow journalism"), mass immigration from Asia ("the yellow peril"), and mass stigmatization (the yellow star that Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany). The Culture of Yellow combines cultural history with innovative readings of literary texts and visual artworks, providing a multilayered account of the unique role played by the color yellow in late nineteenth- and twentieth-century American and European culture.},

                  poetry.Perhaps best known for her outstanding translation of
                  Sappho, poet Mary Barnard (19092001) has until recently
                  received little attention for her own work. In this book,
                  Sarah Barnsley examines Barnards poetry and poetics in the
                  light of her plentiful correspondence with Ezra Pound, William
                  Carlos Williams, and others. Presenting Barnard as a late
                  Imagist, Barnsley links Barnards search for a poetry
                  grounded in native speech to efforts within American modernism
                  for new forms in the American grain. Barnsley finds that where
                  Pound and Williams began the campaign for a modern poetry
                  liberated from the heave of the iambic pentameter,
                  Barnard completed it through a spare but musical
                  aesthetic derived from her studies of Greek metric and
                  American speech rhythms, channeled through materials drawn
                  direct from the American local. The first book on Barnard, and
                  the first to draw on the Barnard archives at Yales
                  Beinecke Library, Mary Barnard, American Imagist unearths a
                  fascinating and previously untold chapter of twentieth-century
                  American poetry.Clearly structured and elegantly written,
                  Mary Barnard, American Imagist far exceeds any act of routine
                  scholarly recovery. In addition to giving full
                  recognition to Barnards superb skills as a translator of
                  Sappho, Sarah Barnsley also makes a convincing case for her
                  original poetic output and for her contribution to the
                  evolution of American free verse.  Peter Nicholls,

  abstract =     {Although it has often been pointed out that the protagonists
                  of Joseph Conrad’s novels frequently fail in what they attempt
                  to achieve, the forces that oppose them have rarely been
                  examined systematically. Furthermore, no sustained attempts
                  have been made to rigorously address the central philosophical
                  issue the characters’ predicament raises: that of the
                  freedom-of-the-will. This interdisciplinary study seeks to
                  remedy this neglect by taking recourse not only to the
                  philosophical debate about free will and determinism but also
                  to the relevant historical, economic, scientific, and literary
                  discourses in the Victorian and Early-Modernist periods.
                  Against this background a paradigmatic analysis of three of
                  Conrad’s most significant novels – Heart of Darkness,
                  Nostromo, and The Secret Agent – investigates the writer’s
                  position in the free will and determinism debate by
                  identifying certain recurring themes in which the
                  freedom-of-the-will problem manifests itself. Light is thereby
                  also thrown on a central Conradian paradox: how Conrad can
                  insist on morality and moral responsibility, which presupposes
                  the existence of free will, in a materialist-deterministic
                  world, which denies it.},

  abstract =     {Katherine Mansfield's arrival in London in 1908 marked the
                  start of her professional career as a writer and this study
                  marks a revival of her reputation as one of the foremost
                  practitioners of the short story. The international line-up of
                  contributors attests to Mansfield's global appeal. By
                  discussing her fiction in relation to her life, the
                  contributors to this critical work present reinterpretations
                  and readings. Enhanced by new transcriptions of manuscripts
                  and access to her diaries and letters, these readings combine
                  biographical approaches with critical-theoretical ones and
                  focus not only on philosophy and fiction, but class and
                  gender, biography/autobiography. The historical and aesthetic
                  studies of Mansfield's work all take place within a framework

                  Conrad's novels and short stories have consistently figured
                  into - and helped to define - the dominant trends in literary
                  criticism. This book is the first to provide a thorough yet
                  accessible overview of Conrad scholarship and criticism
                  spanning the entire history of Conrad studies, from the 1895
                  publication of his first book, Almayer's Folly, to the
                  present. While tracing the general evolution of the commentary
                  surrounding Conrad's work, John G. Peters's careful analysis
                  also evaluates Conrad's impact on critical trends such as the
                  belles lettres tradition, the New Criticism, psychoanalysis,
                  structuralist and post-structuralist criticism, narratology,
                  postcolonial studies, gender and women's studies, and
                  ecocriticism. The breadth and scope of Peters's study make

                  form for the freedom and variety it offered. The nineteen
                  stories in this selection span James's career, from brief
                  tales to longer works, all exploring his concerns with the old

                  unsophisticated American girl abroad, and 'In the Cage'

  abstract = {Bertolt Brecht's term (also sometimes translated as alienation-effect) for the moment in a work of art when that which used to appear natural suddenly appears historical, when that which was thought of as timeless and eternal is seen as deliberately caused and altered across time. Its purpose is political because it aims to overturn the paralysing sense that things have always been ‘this way’ and therefore that there is nothing that can be done to change them. Brecht's principal means of doing this was to stage theatre in such a way that the viewer is denied the habitual comfort of forgetting that they are watching a play and becoming (what psychoanalytic film critics call) sutured into the events on stage. Thus he would discourage actors from ‘becoming’ their characters and using that to elicit the empathy of the audience, preferring that they create a sense of ‘distance’ between themselves and their character that would put the audience in two minds about what they were watching (Brecht's ideal manner of viewing, he famously said, was that of the sports fan evaluating a boxing match). French cultural critic Roland Barthes deployed this principal in Mythologies (1957), translated as Mythologies (1972), which is a spirited attack on everything that appears ‘natural’ in modern life in the era of late capitalism.

                  nineteenth-century writers in using “the unseen” to adumbrate

                  of William James, who speculated that what mediated between
                  the unseen (for him, the source of all religious feeling) and
                  conscious experience was what he called the subconscious. It

                  that allows us to use what we know about our physical and

                  simultaneously explain both universality and diversity in
                  metaphorical thought? Cognitive linguists have done important
                  work on universal aspects of metaphor, but they have paid much
                  less attention to why metaphors vary both interculturally and
                  intraculturally as extensively as they do. In this book,
                  Zoltán Kövecses proposes a new theory of metaphor variation.
                  First, he identifies the major dimension of metaphor
                  variation, that is, those social and cultural boundaries that
                  signal discontinuities in human experience. Second, he
                  describes which components, or aspects of conceptual metaphor
                  are involved in metaphor variation, and how they are involved.
                  Third, he isolates the main causes of metaphor variation.
                  Fourth Professor Kövecses addresses the issue to the degree of
                  cultural coherence in the interplay among conceptual
                  metaphors, embodiment, and causes of metaphor variation.},

  abstract =     {In this richly illustrated account of black-white contacts
                  from the Pharaohs to the Caesars, Frank Snowden demonstrates
                  that the ancients did not discriminate against blacks because
                  of their color. For three thousand years Mediterranean whites
                  intermittently came in contact with African blacks in commerce
                  and war, and left a record of these encounters in art and in
                  written documents. The blacks--most commonly known as
                  Kushites, Ethiopians, or Nubians--were redoubtable warriors
                  and commanded the respect of their white adversaries. The
                  overall view of blacks was highly favorable. In science,
                  philosophy, and religion color was not the basis of theories
                  concerning inferior peoples. And early Christianity saw in the
                  black man a dramatic symbol of its catholic mission. This book
                  sheds light on the reasons for the absence in antiquity of
                  virulent color prejudice and for the difference in attitudes
                  of whites toward blacks in ancient and modern societies.},

  shorttitle =   {Solid {{Objects}}},
  abstract =     {In this provocative and wide-ranging study, Douglas Mao argues
                  that a profound tension between veneration of human production
                  and anxiety about production's dangers lay at the heart of
                  literary modernism. Focusing on the work of Virginia Woolf,
                  Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound, and Wallace Stevens, Mao shows that
                  modernists were captivated by physical objects, which,
                  regarded as objects, seemed to partake of a utopian serenity
                  beyond the reach of human ideological conflicts. Under a
                  variety of historical pressures, Mao observes, these writers
                  came to revere the making of such things, and especially the
                  crafting of the work of art, as the surest guarantee of
                  meaning for an individual life. Yet they also found troubling
                  contradictions here, since any kind of making, be it
                  handicraft or mass production, could also be understood as a
                  violation of the nonhuman world by an increasingly predatory
                  and imperialistic subjectivity. If modernists began by
                  embracing production as a test of meaning, then they
                  frequently ended by testing production itself and finding it
                  wanting.To make this case, Mao interweaves social and
                  political history with readings in literature, the visual
                  arts, philosophy, and economics. He explores modernism's
                  relation to aestheticism, existentialism, and the culture of
                  consumption, joining current debates on the politics of
                  engagement and the social meanings of art. And he shows
                  conclusively, in this elegantly written and consistently
                  surprising work, that we cannot understand the theories and
                  practices of modernism without addressing the question of the
                  object and production's ambivalent allure.},

                  studies of the passage of modernism to postmodernism, returns
                  to the movement that dramatically broke with all tradition in
                  search of progress for the first time since his acclaimed A
                  Singular Modernity .The Modernist Papers is a tour de froce of
                  anlysis and criticism, in which Jameson brings his dynamic and
                  acute thought to bear on the modernist literature of the
                  nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Jameson discusses
                  modernist poetics, including intensive discussions of the work
                  of Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Wallace Stevens, Joyce,
                  Proust, and Thomas Mann. He explores the peculiarties of the
                  American literary field, taking in William Carlos Williams and
                  the American epic, and examines the language theories of
                  Gertrude Stein. Refusing to see modernism as simply a Western
                  phenomenon he also pays close attention to its Japanese
                  expression; while the complexities of a late modernist
                  representation of twentieth-century politics are articulated
                  in a concluding section on Peter Weiss’s novel The Aesthetics
                  of Resistance.Challenging our previous understanding of the
                  literature of this pperiod, this monumental work will come to

  abstract =     {Jesse Matz examines the writing of such modernists as Henry
                  James, Joseph Conrad and Virginia Woolf, who used the word
                  'impression' to describe what they wanted their fiction to
                  present. Matz redefines literary Impressionism, focusing on
                  the way that impressions destroy standard perceptual
                  distinctions between thinking and sensing, believing and
                  suspecting. He argues that these writers favoured not
                  immediate subjective sense, but rather a mode that would
                  mediate perceptual distinctions. Just as impressions fall
                  somewhere between thought and sense, Impressionist fiction
                  occupies the middle ground between opposite ways of engaging
                  with the world. Matz also argues that the resulting confusion
                  becomes a basic plot feature of modernist fiction. This
                  wide-ranging 2001 study addresses the problems of perception
                  and representation that occupied writers in the early decades

                  disintegration in his constant re-narration of the past. Using
                  the author's personal letters as a guide to understanding his
                  fiction, Said draws an important parallel between Conrad's
                  view of his own life and the manner and form of his stories.
                  The critic also argues that the author, who set his fiction in
                  exotic locations like East Asia and Africa, projects political
                  dimensions in his work that mirror a colonialist preoccupation
                  with "civilizing" native peoples. Said then suggests that this
                  dimension should be considered when reading all of Western
                  literature. First published in 1966, Said's critique of the
                  Western self's struggle with modernity signaled the beginnings
                  of his groundbreaking work, Orientalism, and remains a

                  entire European tradition of philosophy—called
                  deconstruction—changed the face of criticism. It provoked a
                  questioning of philosophy, literature, and the human sciences
                  that these disciplines would have previously considered
                  improper. Forty years after Of Grammatology first appeared in

                  and cultural studies is the investigation of space and
                  geography, a trend which is proving particularly important for
                  modernist studies. This volume explores the interface between
                  modernism and geography in a range of writers, texts and
                  artists across the twentieth century. Cross-disciplinary
                  essays test and extend a variety of methodological approaches
                  and reveal the reach of this topic into every corner of
                  modernist scholarship. From Imagist poetry and the Orient to
                  teashops and modernism in London, or from mapping and
                  belonging in James Joyce or Joseph Conrad to the space of new
                  media artists, this remarkable volume offers fresh,
                  invigorating research that ranges across the field of
                  modernism. It also serves to identify the many exciting new
                  directions that future studies may take. With groundbreaking
                  essays from an international team of highly-regarded scholars,

  shorttitle =   {Perception},
  abstract =     {Perception is one of the oldest and most deeply investigated
                  topics in the field of psychology, and it also raises some
                  profound philosophical questions. It is concerned with how we
                  use the information reaching our senses to guide and control
                  our behavior as well as to create our particular, subjective
                  experiences of the surrounding world. In this Very Short
                  Introduction, Brian J. Rogers discusses the philosophical
                  question of what it means to perceive, as well as describing
                  how we are able to perceive the particular characteristics of
                  objects and scenes such as their lightness, color, form,
                  depth, and motion. What we perceive, however, does not always
                  correspond to what exists in the world and, as Rogers shows,
                  the study of illusions can be useful in telling us something
                  about the nature and limitations of our perceptual processes.
                  Rogers also explores perception from an evolutionary
                  perspective, explaining how evolutionary pressures have shaped
                  the perceptual systems of humans and other animals. He shows
                  that perception is not necessarily a separate and independent
                  process but rather part of a "perceptual system," involving
                  both the extraction of perceptual information and the control
                  of action. Rogers goes on to cover the significant progress
                  made recently in the understanding of perception through the
                  use of precise and controlled psychophysical methods, single
                  cell recordings, and imaging techniques. There have also been
                  many insights from attempts to model perceptual processes in
                  artificial systems. As Rogers shows, these attempts have
                  revealed how difficult it is to program machines to perform
                  even the most simple of perceptual tasks that we take for
                  granted. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series

                  Said's groundbreaking critique of the West's historical,

                  modern classic.In this wide-ranging, intellectually vigorous
                  study, Said traces the origins of "orientalism" to the
                  centuries-long period during which Europe dominated the Middle
                  and Near East and, from its position of power, defined "the
                  orient" simply as "other than" the occident. This entrenched
                  view continues to dominate western ideas and, because it does
                  not allow the East to represent itself, prevents true
                  understanding. Essential, and still eye-opening, Orientalism

  abstract =     {The category of vision is significant for Modernist texts as
                  well as for the unfolding discourse of Modernism itself.
                  Within the general Modernist fascination with the artistic and
                  experimental possibilities of vision and perception this study
                  looks at Virginia Woolf’s novels and her critical writings and
                  examines the relation between visuality and aesthetics. An
                  aesthetics of vision, as this study argues, becomes a
                  productive principle of narrative. The visual is not only
                  pertinent to Woolf’s processes of composition, but her works
                  create a kind of vision that is proper to the text itself – a
                  vision that reflects on the experience of seeing and
                  renegotiates the relation between the reader and the text. The
                  study investigates key dimensions of aesthetic vision. It
                  addresses vision in the context of theories of aesthetic
                  experience and identifies a semantics of seeing. It analyses
                  functions of symbolic materiality in the presentation of
                  boundaries of perception, modes of temporality and poetic
                  potentialities. In exploring the connections between vision
                  and language, it seeks to provide new perspectives for a
                  reassessment of what occurs in Modernism's relation to

  abstract =     {Chinese culture held a well-known fascination for modernist
                  poets like Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams. What is
                  less known but is made fully clear by Zhaoming Qian is the
                  degree to which oriental culture made these poets the
                  modernists they became. This ambitious and illuminating study
                  shows that Orientalism, no less than French symbolism and
                  Italian culture, is a constitutive element of
                  Modernism.Consulting rare and unpublished materials, Qian
                  traces Pound's and Williams's remarkable dialogues with the
                  great Chinese poets—Qu Yuan, Li Bo, Wang Wei, and Bo
                  Juyi—between 1913 and 1923. His investigation reveals that
                  these exchanges contributed more than topical and thematic
                  ideas to the Americans' work and suggests that their
                  progressively modernist style is directly linked to a steadily
                  growing contact and affinity for similar Chinese styles. He
                  demonstrates, for example, how such influences as the ethics
                  of pictorial representation, the style of ellipsis, allusion,
                  and juxtaposition, and the Taoist/Zen–Buddhist notion of
                  nonbeing/being made their way into Pound's pre-Fenollosan
                  Chinese adaptations, Cathay, Lustra, and the Early Cantos, as
                  well as Williams's Sour Grapes and Spring and All. Developing
                  a new interpretation of important work by Pound and Williams,
                  Orientalism and Modernism fills a significant gap in accounts
                  of American Modernism, which can be seen here for the first
                  time in its truly multicultural character.},

                  addressing the primary areas of inquiry: history, genre and
                  medium, analysis and criticism, and interpretation. Chapters
                  in Part I cover the range most broadly, from the relations of
                  music and the soundtrack to opera and film, textual
                  representation of film sound, film music as studied by
                  cognitive scientists, and Hanns Eisler's work as film composer
                  and co-author of the foundational text Composing for the Films
                  (1947). Part II addresses genre and medium with chapters
                  focusing on cartoons and animated films, the film musical,
                  music in arcade and early video games, and the interplay of
                  film, music, and recording over the past half century. The
                  chapters in Part III offer case studies in interpretation
                  along with extended critical surveys of theoretical models of
                  gender, sexuality, and subjectivity as they impinge on music
                  and sound. The three chapters on analysis in Part IV are
                  diverse: one systematically models harmonies used in recent
                  films, a second looks at issues of music and film temporality,
                  and a third focuses on television. Chapters on history (Part
                  V) cover topics including musical antecedents in
                  nineteenth-century theater, the complex issues in
                  sychronization of music in performance of early (silent)
                  films, international practices in early film exhibition, and
                  the symphony orchestra in film.},

                  attitudes to the cinema before looking in detail at examples

                  The Winding Stair and Other Poems, a famously beautiful,
                  elegant volume intended as a companion to The Tower—with an
                  Introduction and notes by the eminent Yeats scholar George
                  Bornstein. Published in 1933 when W.B. Yeats was sixty-eight,
                  The Winding Stair and Other Poems is his longest stand-alone
                  volume of verse. Previously unavailable as a single volume,
                  this beautiful edition will appeal to both general readers and
                  textual scholars. Featuring sixty-four poems from the late
                  1920s and early 1930s, among them such masterpieces as “Blood
                  and the Moon,” “Byzantium,” the Coole Park poems,
                  “Vacillation,” and two separately titled long sequences
                  including the Crazy Jane poems and ending with the exquisite
                  lyric “From the ‘Antigone,’” this edition also includes an
                  Introduction and notes by celebrated Yeats scholar George
                  Bornstein. These poems amply justify T. S. Eliot’s contention
                  that Yeats was one of the few poets “whose history is the
                  history of their own time, who are a part of the consciousness
                  of an age which cannot be understood without them.”},

                  functions of the press, censorship, Irish cultural history,

                  essays that are consciously public, direct,and communicative.
                  It covers forty years of Joyce's life and maps important
                  changes in his opinions about politics, especially Irish
                  politics, about the relationship of literature to history, and
                  about writers who remained important to him such as Mangan,
                  Blake, Defoe, Ibsen, Wilde, and Shaw.These pieces also clarify
                  and illuminate the transformations in Joyce's fiction, from
                  Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man to the
                  first drafts of Ulysses. Gathering together more than fifty

                  century, beginning in 1946 with Roberto Busa’s plans for the
                  Index Thomisticus, a massive attempt to encode nearly 11
                  million words of Thomas Aquinas’ writings on IBM punch cards.
                  This event (and the narrative that follows) is found
                  throughout the literature, leading some to believe that early
                  DH work ‘concentrated, perhaps somewhat narrowly, on text
                  analysis (such as classification systems, mark-up, text
                  encoding, and scholarly editing)’ (Presner, 2010, p. 6).
                  Others seem convinced that DH is still only text analysis or
                  too dominated by it (Meeks, 2013)—and misguided in its
                  approach (Fish, 2012). Meanwhile, Underwood (2017) has
                  recently made a case for disentangling distant reading methods
                  from DH generally, noting that the former predates and does
                  not depend on digital technology.This article presents an
                  empirical perspective on the early history of DH by tracing
                  publications in two foundational journals (Computers and the
                  Humanities (CHum), established in 1966, and Literary and
                  Linguistic Computing (LLC), established in 1986), with
                  particular emphasis on media types, authors’ disciplines and
                  locations, and teaching and learning. In doing so, we examine
                  the extent to which early DH work focused on text analysis as
                  well as broader trends in the early history of the field.}",

  abstract =     { Synaesthesia has previously been linked with imagery
                  abilities, although an understanding of a causal role for
                  mental imagery in broader synaesthetic experiences remains
                  elusive. This can be partly attributed to our relatively poor
                  understanding of imagery in sensory domains beyond vision.
                  Investigations into the neural and behavioural underpinnings
                  of mental imagery have nevertheless identified an important
                  role for imagery in perception, particularly in mediating
                  cross-modal interactions. However, the phenomenology of
                  synaesthesia gives rise to the assumption that associated
                  cross-modal interactions may be encapsulated and specific to
                  synaesthesia. As such, evidence for a link between imagery and
                  perception may not generalize to synaesthesia. Here, we
                  present results that challenge this idea: first, we found
                  enhanced somatosensory imagery evoked by visual stimuli of
                  body parts in mirror-touch synaesthetes, relative to other
                  synaesthetes or controls. Moreover, this enhanced imagery
                  generalized to tactile object properties not directly linked
                  to their synaesthetic associations. Second, we report evidence
                  that concurrent experience evoked in grapheme—colour
                  synaesthesia was sufficient to trigger visual-to-tactile
                  correspondences that are common to all. Together, these
                  findings show that enhanced mental imagery is a consistent
                  hallmark of synaesthesia, and suggest the intriguing
                  possibility that imagery may facilitate the cross-modal
                  interactions that underpin synaesthesic experiences. This
                  article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Bridging
                  senses: novel insights from synaesthesia’. }

@book{newport2016deepwork,
  abstract =     {Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a
                  cognitively demanding task. It’s a skill that allows you to
                  quickly master complicated information and produce better
                  results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what
                  you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes
                  from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power
                  in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy.
                  And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep—spending
                  their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social
                  media, not even realizing there’s a better way. In Deep Work,
                  author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact
                  in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he
                  instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this
                  book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost
                  any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce
                  massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training
                  regimen, presented as a series of four “rules,” for
                  transforming your mind and habits to support this skill. A mix
                  of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes
                  the reader on a journey through memorable stories—from Carl
                  Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to
                  a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class
                  ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the
                  air—and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most
                  serious professionals should quit social media and that you
                  should practice being bored.},

By treating Indigenous knowledge as a commodity, speech and language technologists risk disenfranchising local knowledge authorities, reenacting the causes of language endangerment. Scholars in related fields have responded to calls for decolonisation, and we in the speech and language technology community need to follow suit, and explore what this means for our practices that involve Indigenous languages and the communities who own them. This paper reviews colonising discourses in speech and language technology, and suggests new ways of working with Indigenous communities, and seeks to open a discussion of a postcolonial approach to computational methods for supporting language vitality.",

Yet few are aware of a parallel crisis for languages, with predicted extinction rates ranging from 50 to 90 \% of the world’s some 7,000 languages by the end of this century. Many regard languages as a benchmark for cultural diversity because virtually every major aspect of human culture ranging from kinship classification to religion is dependent on language for its transmission. This chapter focuses primarily on the consequences of the global loss of linguistic diversity for cultural diversity. Discontinuities in transmission of culture and language are frequently accompanied by large human and social costs. Maintaining the world’s languages can be seen as part of a larger strategy of cultural survival providing an indispensable foundation for well-being and resilience.},

              rendering of the word for “civilization,” for instance, means “enlightening through writing/text” (

For centuries, writing has been invoked as a positive index to the hierarchy of human societies and their intellectual attributes, whereby orality is relegated to primitive and pretechnological cultures. The presumed dichotomy of writing and orality often relies on a flawed, representational view of writing that is phonocentric to the core, à la Derrida, and remains almost always blind to the presence of script or medium—including that of alphabetical writing—which requires a different kind of analytical approach.},

There are many sources too for basic information on the extensions to the WWW that permit content to be expressed in natural language yet used by software agents to easily find, share and integrate information. Until now individuals engaged in creating ontologies-- formal descriptions of the concepts, terms, and relationships within a given knowledge domain-- have had no sources beyond the technical standards documents. Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist transforms this information into the practical knowledge that programmers and subject domain experts need. Authors Allemang and Hendler begin with solutions to the basic problems, but don't stop there: they demonstrate how to develop your own solutions to problems of increasing complexity and ensure that your skills will keep pace with the continued evolution of the Semantic Web. - Provides practical information for all programmers and subject matter experts engaged in modeling data to fit the requirements of the Semantic Web. - De-emphasizes algorithms and proofs, focusing instead on real-world problems, creative solutions, and highly illustrative examples. - Presents detailed, ready-to-apply?recipes\{u0094\} for use in many specific situations. - Shows how to create new recipes from RDF, RDFS, and OWL constructs.},

For this purpose, a whole suite of standards, technologies and related tools have been specified and developed over the last couple of years, and they have now become the foundation for numerous new applications. A Developer's Guide to the Semantic Web helps the reader to learn the core standards, key components, and underlying concepts. It provides in-depth coverage of both the what-is and how-to aspects of the Semantic Web. From Yu's presentation, the reader will obtain not only a solid understanding about the Semantic Web, but also learn how to combine all the pieces to build new applications on the Semantic Web. The second edition of this book not only adds detailed coverage of the latest W3C standards such as SPARQL 1.1 and RDB2RDF, it also updates the readers by following recent developments. More specifically, it includes five new chapters on schema.org and semantic markup, on Semantic Web technologies used in social networks, and on new applications and projects such as data.gov and Wikidata, and it also provides a complete coding example of building a search engine that supports Rich Snippets. Software developers in industry and students specializing in Web development or Semantic Web technologies will find in this book the most complete guide to this exciting field available today. Based on the step-by-step presentation of real-world projects, where the technologies and standards are applied, they will acquire the knowledge needed to design and implement state-of-the-art applications},

	abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

A prediction is educed that as the degree of color association value for sets of words vary, the extent of response interference will vary directly. Five different lists, including three distinct levels of color associativity, were used in a repeated measurement Latin Square design. Results indicate a close correspondence between color association value and response interference. Word frequency is discussed as an important antecedent variable for response interference, whose role remains to be defined. It is suggested that a highly precise model for predicting interference times is feasible.},

                  machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical
                  machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at
                  building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to
                  maximize the translation performance. The models proposed
                  recently for neural machine translation often belong to a
                  family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that
                  encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from
                  which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we
                  conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a
                  bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic
                  encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by
                  allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a
                  source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,
                  without having to form these parts as a hard segment
                  explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation
                  performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art
                  phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French
                  translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that
                  the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our
                  intuition.},

  abstract =     {The use of Project Gutenberg (PG) as a text corpus has been
                  extremely popular in statistical analysis of language for more
                  than 25 years. However, in contrast to other major linguistic
                  datasets of similar importance, no consensual full version of
                  PG exists to date. In fact, most PG studies so far either
                  consider only a small number of manually selected books,
                  leading to potential biased subsets, or employ vastly
                  different pre-processing strategies (often specified in
                  insufficient details), raising concerns regarding the
                  reproducibility of published results. In order to address
                  these shortcomings, here we present the Standardized Project
                  Gutenberg Corpus (SPGC), an open science approach to a curated
                  version of the complete PG data containing more than 50,000
                  books and more than $3 \times 10^9$ word-tokens. Using
                  different sources of annotated metadata, we not only provide a
                  broad characterization of the content of PG, but also show
                  different examples highlighting the potential of SPGC for
                  investigating language variability across time, subjects, and
                  authors. We publish our methodology in detail, the code to
                  download and process the data, as well as the obtained corpus
                  itself on 3 different levels of granularity (raw text,
                  timeseries of word tokens, and counts of words). In this way,
                  we provide a reproducible, pre-processed, full-size version of
                  Project Gutenberg as a new scientific resource for corpus
                  linguistics, natural language processing, and information
                  retrieval.},

                  five languages: English, German, Italian, Portuguese, and
                  Russian. The data set is intended to support natural language
                  processing applications by providing links between idioms
                  across languages. The underlying data was crawled and
                  integrated from various sources. To ensure the quality of the
                  crawled data, all idioms were evaluated by at least two native
                  speakers. Herein, we present the model devised for structuring
                  the data. We also provide the details of linking LIDIOMS to
                  well-known multilingual data sets such as BabelNet. The
                  resulting data set complies with best practices according to

 abstract = {The study of lyric epiphany, essential to any coordination of sociolinguistics and literature, is defined in terms of five considerations (e.g., its role in political rhetoric), and linguistic criteria such as phonic compression. One track in the argument deals with lyric epiphany in ordinary language (e.g., M.L. King's speeches), in prose (e.g., Cather and Tolstoy), and in the long poem. The second, intermittently intersecting track consists of intense analyses of four cases of linguistic epiphany in "The Odyssey" that involve (1) semantically ramifying root symbols such as the olive in Greece, (2) simile concentration, as in the reverse similes that commute antithetical subcategories, (3) phonic texturing (e.g., alliteration, phonaesthesia), and as a limiting case, (4) epiphany through chiasmus. The conclusions suggest the universal, cross-language and cross-cultural reality of lyric epiphany (e.g., not just classic Russian and Homeric Greek, but Quechua, Eskimo, and Sanskrit and Hebrew religious texts). Lyric epiphany is a subtype of generic epiphany: an intuition or revelation of truth values beyond language and empirical experience. Lyric epiphany, while a component of classical poetics -- both Western and Eastern -- and a subcategory of ideologies of Primitivism and, within that, of Modernism, is also, like the human body, part of the human experience that can and should be studied as part of cultural linguistics and sociolinguistics.},

 abstract = {This article explores Joyce's anachronistic approach to the bildungsroman in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man through a study of the novel's structure. Throughout the first four chapters of A Portrait, Joyce uses the Catholic sacraments as a model of arrangement to chart Stephen's development towards the artist's vocation. Tracing explicit and implicit references to the sacraments in the novel, I argue that Stephen undergoes—either figuratively or literally—baptism, reconciliation, communion, and confirmation before being offered the opportunity to receive holy orders. Once he rejects the priest-hood, a new model of arrangement emerges, one that subverts the teleology of both the conventional bildungsroman and the sacraments themselves.},

                  embeddings. The learning models behind the software are
                  described in two research papers. We found the description of
                  the models in these papers to be somewhat cryptic and hard to

  abstract =     {Recognizing the flow of time in a story is a crucial aspect of
                  understanding it. Prior work related to time has primarily
                  focused on identifying temporal expressions or relative
                  sequencing of events, but here we propose computationally
                  annotating each line of a book with wall clock times, even in
                  the absence of explicit time-descriptive phrases. To do so, we
                  construct a data set of hourly time phrases from 52,183
                  fictional books. We then construct a time-of-day
                  classification model that achieves an average error of 2.27
                  hours. Furthermore, we show that by analyzing a book in whole
                  using dynamic programming of breakpoints, we can roughly
                  partition a book into segments that each correspond to a
                  particular time-of-day. This approach improves upon baselines
                  by over two hours. Finally, we apply our model to a corpus of
                  literature categorized by different periods in history, to
                  show interesting trends of hourly activity throughout the
                  past. Among several observations we find that the fraction of
                  events taking place past 10 P.M jumps past 1880 - coincident
                  with the advent of the electric light bulb and city lights.},

 abstract = {The required graduate reading lists of 56 leading Ph.D.-granting Spanish faculties in the United States were analyzed to characterize the current canon for Spanish and Spanish American literature. The database consisted of 14,686 items. Little consensus was found regarding authors, and even less for specific works of literature. Only two authors and two works from Spain achieved 100 percent representation on the lists. Thirty-nine authors (one female) and 22 male-authored works from Spain, and 24 authors (two female) and ten male-authored works from Spanish America were present on 75 percent or more of the lists. At the other end of the spectrum, nearly 1,000 different titles appeared just once in the database, demonstrating presence on only a single reading list. The findings show little agreement about what constitutes literary value in this field. This has important implications for graduate education.},

  url =          {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:umu:diva-86},
  abstractNote = {This thesis examines usage of English colour terms in context,
                  based on an extensive computerised text corpus, the Bank of
                  English. It describes the ways in which English colour terms
                  may be used to refer to nuances outside their normal area of
                  designation and to attributes outside the colour domain. Usage
                  patterns are analysed on three different levels: with regard
                  to the overall frequency of occurrences, nominal domains and
                  individual tokens, respectively.Cognitive linguistics supplies
                  the theoretical framework employed in the analyses of the
                  observed patterns. The study identifies three types of usage
                  where colour terms refer to peripheral colour nuances or to
                  concepts outside the colour domain: classifying, figurative
                  and marked usage.When a colour term has a classifying
                  function, it can be used outside the normal area of
                  designation. This usage is analysed as a type of
                  reference-point construction where a term referring to a
                  salient point in the colour domain is used to subcategorise an
                  entity whose actual colour may be only a peripheral member of
                  the category named by the colour term. An analysis of the OED
                  and the Bank of English shows that this type of usage is
                  primarily restricted to a few of the most salient basic
                  terms.This study points to the close affinities between
                  classifying and figurative usage. Figurative expressions of
                  colour terms frequently have a classifying function. I argue
                  that figurative meanings are derived through two types of
                  metonymy: +SALIENT ATTRIBUTE FOR OBJECT+ and +SALIENT CONCRETE
                  ATTRIBUTE FOR SALIENT ABSTRACT ATTRIBUTE+.Marked usage arises
                  when specific colour terms are used in nominal domains where
                  the specificity is not expected. This phenomenon is
                  consequently confined to non-basic colour terms.On the basis

  abstract =     { We survey latent variable models for solving data-analysis
                  problems. A latent variable model is a probabilistic model
                  that encodes hidden patterns in the data. We uncover these
                  patterns from their conditional distribution and use them to
                  summarize data and form predictions. Latent variable models
                  are important in many fields, including computational biology,
                  natural language processing, and social network analysis. Our
                  perspective is that models are developed iteratively: We build
                  a model, use it to analyze data, assess how it succeeds and
                  fails, revise it, and repeat. We describe how new research has
                  transformed these essential activities. First, we describe
                  probabilistic graphical models, a language for formulating
                  latent variable models. Second, we describe mean field
                  variational inference, a generic algorithm for approximating
                  conditional distributions. Third, we describe how to use our
                  analyses to solve problems: exploring the data, forming
                  predictions, and pointing us in the direction of improved
                  models. }

The most popular kind is one or another variant of Locke’shypothetical case of “spectrum inversion”, in whichstrawberries and ripe tomatoes produce visual experiences of the sortthat are actually produced by grass and cucumbers, grass and cucumbersproduce experiences of the sort that are actually produced bystrawberries and ripe tomatoes, and so on. This entry surveys the mainphilosophical applications of what Dennett has called “one ofphilosophy’s most virulent memes” (1991, 389)., Section 1 explains what “qualia” are supposed to be.Section 2 describes the many different sorts of “invertedqualia” (specifically, “inverted spectrum”) thoughtexperiments, including a close cousin that does not involve inversion.Section 3 discusses the major philosophical arguments that appeal tospectrum inversion., This article is long and goes into intricate details that some readerswill wish to ignore. Those wanting a shorter introduction should readsection 1 (skipping subsection 1.1), section 2 (subsections 2.1, 2.2,2.3), and subsection 3.1. (Another shorter introduction is Ross 2020.)Those new to the topic should first read the entry on qualia.},

  abstract = 	 {Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist  approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6% for IJB-A and 86.2% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.}

	abstract = {"Female Sexuality in Modernist Fiction: Literary Techniques for Making Women Artists provides a chronological investigation of the innovative writing styles of canonical modernist writers to reveal a shift in gendered representations of sexual subjectivity. Positioned at the nexus of studies on the body and sexuality in modernist literature, this project addresses the complex ways that constructions of female sexuality are understood culturally, politically, and epistemologically. Using close reading strategies to identify how modernist authors challenge representations of female positionality as passive, case studies consider how canonical modernist authors - Virginia Woolf, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, and Samuel Beckett - found new ways to represent women as embodied, sexual, desired and desiring subjects through prose, poetry, and drama. Chapters address Woolf's Orlando: A Biography (1928), Yeats' The Winding Stair and Other Poems (1933), Joyce's Finnegans Wake (1939), Beckett's Not I (1972) and other dramatic works. By rendering sexuality more obviously as a component of female character, these works of modernist literature shape our understanding of the artistic body as a structure for thinking about "woman" as a linguistic construct and material reality. This study will be of great interest to scholars in English Literature, Women and Gender Studies and Sexuality Studies"--},

Once a scandalously inventive puppeteer, Mickey is now in his mid-sixties and besieged by ghostsof his mother, his beloved brother, his vanished first wife, his mistress of thirteen years. Bereft and grieving, he embarks on a turbulent journey back into his past, one that brings him to the brink of madness and extinction. But no matter how ardently he courts death, he is too exuberantly alive to succeed at dying. Sabbath's Theater is a comic creation of epic proportions, and Mickey Sabbath is its gargantuan hero.},

In this article, we will systematically review the current development of these algorithms and introduce their practical applications on different types of experimental data. We come to the conclusion that short-read alignment is no longer the bottleneck of data analyses.

We present Enhanced WSD Integrating Synset Embeddings and Relations (EWISER), a neural supervised architecture that is able to tap into this wealth of knowledge by embedding information from the LKB graph within the neural architecture, and to exploit pretrained synset embeddings, enabling the network to predict synsets that are not in the training set. As a result, we set a new state of the art on almost all the evaluation settings considered, also breaking through, for the first time, the 80{\%} ceiling on the concatenation of all the standard all-words English WSD evaluation benchmarks. On multilingual all-words WSD, we report state-of-the-art results by training on nothing but English.",

abstract = {Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the ability to identify the meaning of words in context in a computational manner. WSD is considered an AI-complete problem, that is, a task whose solution is at least as hard as the most difficult problems in artificial intelligence. We introduce the reader to the motivations for solving the ambiguity of words and provide a description of the task. We overview supervised, unsupervised, and knowledge-based approaches. The assessment of WSD systems is discussed in the context of the Senseval/Semeval campaigns, aiming at the objective evaluation of systems participating in several different disambiguation tasks. Finally, applications, open problems, and future directions are discussed.},

abstract = {In natural language processing, conflation is the process of merging or lumping together nonidentical words which refer to the same principal concept. This can relate both to words which are entirely different in form (e.g., "group" and "collection"), and to words which share some common root (e.g., "group", "grouping", "subgroups"). In the former case the words can only be mapped by referring to a dictionary or thesaurus, but in the latter case use can be made of the orthographic similarities between the forms. One popular approach is to remove affixes from the input words, thus reducing them to a stem; if this could be done correctly, all the variant forms of a word would be converted to the same standard form. Since the process is aimed at mapping for retrieval purposes, the stem need not be a linguistically correct lemma or root (see also Frakes 1982).},

In a lively and wide-ranging discussion, Peter Nicholls argues that the distinctive feature of Modernism is its diversity. Providing original analytic accounts of each of the main movements, he explores the ways in which the new stylistic developments were closely bound up with a shifting politics of gender and authority. Modernisms introduces the reader to a wealth of literary experiment, beginning in the nineteenth century world of Baudelaire and Mallarme and moving forward into the recognisably modern one of the first avant-gardes. Close readings of key texts monitor the explosive histories of Futurism, Expressionism, Cubism, Dada and Surrealist - histories which allow the familiar terrain of Anglo-American Modernism to be seen in a strikingly different light. Modernisms invites us to rethink our habits of reading seminal works of twentieth-century British and American literature, transforming one thing into many, and evoking the richness and diversity of a cultural moment which continues to shape our own.},

pages="136--145",
abstract="This paper presents an adaptation of Lesk's dictionarybased word sense disambiguation algorithm. Rather than using a standard dictionary as the source of glosses for our approach, the lexical database WordNet is employed. This provides a rich hierarchy of semantic relations that our algorithm can exploit. This method is evaluated using the English lexical sample data from the Senseval-2 word sense disambiguation exercise, and attains an overall accuracy of 32{\%}. This represents a significant improvement over the 16{\%} and 23{\%} accuracy attained by variations of the Lesk algorithm used as benchmarks during the SENSEVAL-2 comparative exercise among word sense disambiguation systems.",

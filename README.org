** Building

I don't know why you would want to build a copy of my dissertation from scratch, but if you did:

Building requires the Nix package manager. Install nix, and then run:

#+begin_src sh
nix-shell --run shake
#+end_src

(Unless you have ~direnv~ installed, in which case you can just run ~direnv allow~ once, and then ~shake~.)

       " '\\nShe sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head\\nwas leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the\\nodour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.',\n",
       " 'Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way\\nhome; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and\\nafterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One\\ntime there used to be a field there in which they used to play every\\nevening with other people’s children. Then a man from Belfast bought\\nthe field and built houses in it—not like their little brown houses but\\nbright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used\\nto play together in that field—the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns,\\nlittle Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest,\\nhowever, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to\\nhunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually\\nlittle Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father\\ncoming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father\\nwas not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long\\ntime ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her\\nmother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone\\nback to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like\\nthe others, to leave her home.',\n",
       " 'Home! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects\\nwhich she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on\\nearth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those\\nfamiliar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided. And\\nyet during all those years she had never found out the name of the\\npriest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken\\nharmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed\\nMargaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father.\\nWhenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass\\nit with a casual word:',\n",
       " '“He is in Melbourne now.”',\n",
       " 'She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She\\ntried to weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway she had\\nshelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about\\nher. Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business.\\nWhat would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she\\nhad run away with a fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place\\nwould be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She had\\nalways had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people\\nlistening.',\n",
       " '“Miss Hill, don’t you see these ladies are waiting?”',\n",
       " '“Look lively, Miss Hill, please.”',\n",
       " 'She would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores.',\n",
       " 'But in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like\\nthat. Then she would be married—she, Eveline. People would treat her\\nwith respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been.\\nEven now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in\\ndanger of her father’s violence. She knew it was that that had given\\nher the palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for\\nher like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl;\\nbut latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to\\nher only for her dead mother’s sake. And now she had nobody to protect\\nher. Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating\\nbusiness, was nearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the\\ninvariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her\\nunspeakably. She always gave her entire wages—seven shillings—and Harry\\nalways sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from\\nher father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had no\\nhead, that he wasn’t going to give her his hard-earned money to throw\\nabout the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad of a\\nSaturday night. In the end he would give her the money and ask her had\\nshe any intention of buying Sunday’s dinner. Then she had to rush out\\nas quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather\\npurse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and\\nreturning home late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to\\nkeep the house together and to see that the two young children who had\\nbeen left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals\\nregularly. It was hard work—a hard life—but now that she was about to\\nleave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.',\n",
       " 'She was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind,\\nmanly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the night-boat to\\nbe his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home\\nwaiting for her. How well she remembered the first time she had seen\\nhim; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to\\nvisit. It seemed a few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his\\npeaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a\\nface of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet\\nher outside the Stores every evening and see her home. He took her to\\nsee _The Bohemian Girl_ and she felt elated as she sat in an\\nunaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He was awfully fond of music\\nand sang a little. People knew that they were courting and, when he\\nsang about the lass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly\\nconfused. He used to call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had\\nbeen an excitement for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to\\nlike him. He had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck\\nboy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada.\\nHe told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the\\ndifferent services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and\\nhe told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his\\nfeet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country\\njust for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and\\nhad forbidden her to have anything to say to him.',\n",
       " '“I know these sailor chaps,” he said.',\n",
       " 'One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her\\nlover secretly.',\n",
       " 'The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap\\ngrew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest\\nhad been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming\\nold lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very\\nnice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read\\nher out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day,\\nwhen their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill\\nof Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother’s bonnet to\\nmake the children laugh.',\n",
       " 'Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window,\\nleaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of\\ndusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ\\nplaying. She knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night\\nto remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the\\nhome together as long as she could. She remembered the last night of\\nher mother’s illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other\\nside of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The\\norgan-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She\\nremembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying:',\n",
       " '“Damned Italians! coming over here!”',\n",
       " 'As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother’s life laid its spell on\\nthe very quick of her being—that life of commonplace sacrifices closing\\nin final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother’s voice\\nsaying constantly with foolish insistence:',\n",
       " '“Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!”',\n",
       " 'She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape!\\nFrank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But\\nshe wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to\\nhappiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He\\nwould save her.',\n",
       " '\\nShe stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He\\nheld her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying\\nsomething about the passage over and over again. The station was full\\nof soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds\\nshe caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the\\nquay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her\\ncheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God\\nto direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long\\nmournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on\\nthe sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had\\nbeen booked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?\\nHer distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in\\nsilent fervent prayer.',\n",
       " 'A bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:',\n",
       " '“Come!”',\n",
       " 'All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her\\ninto them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron\\nrailing.',\n",
       " '“Come!”',\n",
       " 'No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy.\\nAmid the seas she sent a cry of anguish!',\n",
       " '“Eveline! Evvy!”',\n",
       " 'He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was\\nshouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her white face\\nto him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of\\nlove or farewell or recognition.']"

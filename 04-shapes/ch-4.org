* Introduction

Modernity is increasingly filled with objects. There are 11.4% more objects---artifacts, natural objects, bodies, and more---in the fiction and poetry of 1880–1930 period than of that in the previous century. Although much of this may be owed to the industrial revolution and its mass production of goods, I hope to show that the modernist literary period begins to /see/ objects differently, just as it did with color. Color is bounded and contained by shape, and the retinal cells responsible for color vision, cone cells, are complemented with rod cells which are responsible for the perception of shape. While cones, comprising 6-7 million cells per eye, are responsible for color perception, the much more numerous rod cells, at around 120 million cells, are responsible for night vision, peripheral vision, motion perception, and object recognition. This component of vision is the guiding metaphor for this chapter, which deals with objects, shapes, and bodies.

The modernist attention to detail, and expansion of description, which I show happening in the previous chapter, also takes place in its shapes, outlines, and objects. But like color, matter exists along a kind of spectrum. We may say with confidence that a sunset, at a certain stage, is red, yet it is much more difficult to pinpoint the exact moment it became red, since it passes through a multitude of similar colors along the way. Shape operates in the same way. Objects have shape. And shape is part of what makes an object. So to be an object, it should have shape, and be quantized and discretized: a handful of dust may be an object in the way that a beach full of sand may not. Can we find with the same confidence the moment that matter becomes an object? The point at which it takes on qualities of a discrete entity, such as size, shape, and utility? Like the color spectrum, the matter/object spectrum is semantically slippery.

These problems are compounded, too, once we start talking about the human body, one of the archetypes, as I will argue later, of shape and body. At what point, precisely, does a hand become a fist? Or at what point do thighs become a lap? At what point, during the process of standing up, does a lap disappear? And what are the spatial boundaries of these bodily objects? For instance, what, precisely, are the boundaries of the face, or the head? One's teeth are in one's head, yet when one has a toothache, it is not usually considered a headache. So as with color, shape and objecthood are, to a significant degree, linguistically determined.

So to continue to model the visual imagination of literary modernism, we now turn to shapes, objects, and forms. In literature, objects are coextensive with words, since, objects, although homomorphic with things, are by definition grammatical: they exist in relation to subjects and verbs. They are the stuff of nearly every sentence. So to count objects, one would count words. The experiments of this chapter are, first, to quantify the objects of modernism. Using state-of-the art word sense disambiguation, and hypernym-based categorization, using the Princeton WordNet, I am able to calculate the proportions of objects in a literary text, and to analyze their diachronic trends. I show that objects in fiction and poetry increase by about 11.4%, but that this trend is much more complex than it may appear. Next, I quantify bodies, and their constituent parts, to better understand the visualities of the body in literature, where I find that bodies and body parts appear 64% more in 1920 than in 1800.

Before we arrive at these results, however, some historical context is necessary. Trends in the intellectual climate of Britain, around the turn of the century, account for some of the period's treatment of objects, bodily or otherwise. Thus, to understand the rise of the object in literature, we should first understand how objects were understood in the philosophies and sciences of the day.

* Objects
** Objects in Early 20th Century Theory

As with color, object theory has a long history, across a wide variety of disciplines: in aesthetics, metaphysics, phenomenology, anthropology, psychology, and other disciplines, where it is variously called thing theory, material culture studies, or materiality studies. Objects are, seen through an anthropological and psychological lens, chiefly artifacts which have accumulated socio-cultural significance: those things which are possessed, carry a /telos/, or which otherwise require names, so that they may be discussed. This is especially true of objects as they are represented in language, and even more true of objects as they appear in literature. Thus, a discussion of objects in literature should start with their treatment in these human sciences.

The turn of the century saw the publication and republication of the hugely influential work of early socio-cultural anthropology, /The Golden Bough/, subtitled /A Study in Magic and Religion./ First published in 1890, it was republished a number of times, until it had grown into a twelve-volume edition by 1915 [cite:@frazer_golden_1900]. Its influence on modernist literature, is wide and well-documented, most notably in John Vickery's 1973 /The Literary Impact of The Golden Bough/, which traces its echoes in Yeats, Eliot, Lawrence, and Joyce, among others [cite:@vickery2015literary].

As a work of comparative religion—it was originally subtitled /A Study in Comparative Religion/---it provides taxonomies of "magic," or religious practices of smaller-scale societies, which often highlight their material aspects. Objects in Frazer are usually termed "totems" or "fetishes," now-archaic terms describing artifacts of religious or other social importance. /Fetish/, a polyvalent term which now carries a dismissive tone to ethnographers, arose out of early interactions between African peoples and Europeans. Etymologically derived from Portuguese /fetiço/, it means "magical practice," "spell," or "witchcraft," but ultimately comes from Latin /facticius/, "manufactured" [cite:@pietz1985fetish 5].

In Frazer, "fetish" means more than just a religious object, however. It is sometimes used to mean an object: "the Feloupes of Senegambia cast down their fetishes and drag them about the fields, cursing them till rain falls"; sometimes as social status: "On the Grain Coast the high priest or fetish king, who bears the title of Bodio, is responsible for the health of the community"; for architectural features: "clearly this double-headed fetish at the gateway of the negro villages in Surinam bears a close resemblance to the double-headed images of Janus"; for /genius loci/: "on Mount Agu in Togo there lives a fetish or spirit called Bagba, who is of great importance for the whole of the surrounding country"; for systems of belief: "yet though his power is great ... the rule of the fetish forbids him ever to leave the mountain"; for socially proscripted natural features "the sea is the fetish of the Eyeos, to the north-west of Dahomey, and they and their king are threatened with death by their priests if ever they dare to look on it"; interregal holding cell: "he on whom the choice falls is suddenly seized, bound, and thrown into the fetish-house, where he is kept in durance till he consents to accept the crown"; or many others [cite:@frazer_golden_1996]. In short, /fetish/ in Frazer is a catch-all word for little-understood foreign objects, places, or practices which are imbued with cultural significance.

In Frazer, /fetish/ always implies a social and geographic distance. French or German religious implements, or other important ritual artifacts, are never fetishes, but the term is reserved for societies at a cultural remove from Britain and Europe. As in the previous chapter, where I argue that the presence of a color word depends on a socio-cultural or geographic distance between the viewer and the described object, the presence of culturally significant foreign objects in fiction demand a defamiliarization with their telos. A door-frame, for instance, would not be named as such, in a novel, if it existed only as a waystation between inside and outside. But its cultural distance makes it into what Frazer would call "a double-headed fetish."

The term /fetish/ later came to be ascribed to sexual predilections. In early psychology, Alfred Binet coins the term, /fétishisme érotique/ in 1887: sexual fetishism, in which "l'adoration de ces malades pour des objects inertes comme des bonnets de nuit or des clous de bottines ressemble de tous points à l'adoration du sauvage or du nègre pour des arêtes de poissons ou pour des cailloux brillants, sauf cette différence fondamentale que, dans le culte de nos malades, l'adoration religieuse est remplacée par un appétit sexuel" [cite:@binet1887fétichisme 144].[fn::"The adoration of our patients for inert objects, like nightcaps or boots, resembles in all ways the adorartion of the savage or the negro for fish bones or shiny rocks, except for the fundamental difference that, in the cult of our patients, religious adoration is replaced with a sexual appetite."] Sigmund Freud later expands this into a discussion of a wider range of paraphilias. Freud's explanation, following his characteristically convoluted castration theory, is that "the fetish is a substitute for the penis ... the woman's (the mother's) penis that the little boy once believed in and---for reasons familiar to us---does not want to give up. ... Thus the foot or shoe owes its preference as a fetish---or a part of it---to the circumstance that the inquisitive boy peered at the woman's genitals from below, from her legs up; fur and velvet---as has been long suspected---are a fixation of the sight of the pubic hair..." [cite:@9780701200671 79]. Castration theory aside, we may say that, following Freud, objects as they appear in literature involve mechanisms of fixation that are visual, if not also sexual. This is especially true of body parts, as we shall see later, but is true of inanimate objects, as well.

A related concept, from anthropology and psychology of this period, is the totem. Frazer, in his 1910 /Totemism and Exogamy: a Treatise on Certain Early Forms of Superstition and Society/, defines this as "a class of material objects which a savage regards with superstitious respect, believing that there exists between him and every member of the class an intimate and altogether special relation" [cite:@frazer1910totemism 3]. Frazer is careful not to confuse a totem with a fetish, however: "as distinguished from a fetich, a totem is never an isolated individual, but always a class of objects, generally a species of animals or of plants, more rarely a class of inanimate natural objects, very rarely a class of artificial objects" [cite:@frazer1910totemism 4]. Freud's definition, meanwhile, is somewhat more narrow. He defines a totem, in his 1913 /Totem and Taboo/, subtitled /Some Points of Agreement between the Mental Lives of Savages and Neurotics,/ as, "as a rule an animal (whether edible and harmless or dangerous and feared) and more rarely a plant or a natural phenomenon (such as rain or water), which stands in a peculiar relation to the whole clan" [cite:@9780415253871 5].

In both Freud and Frazer, socio-cultural distance allows for an examination of the object as a culturally important object, while Western culture's /telos/ obscures the visualities of its own objects. Of course, to some degree, all objects are fetishes, by these definitions, and all objects are totems, since an object may not be completely independent of its social or familial importance. This is part of what modernist literature does: through the influence of Freud and Frazer, turn everyday Western objects into fetishes and totems.

This fetishization of the everyday object has much in common with Karl Marx's concept, in economic theory, of /commodity fetishism/. There, Marx extends the fetish analogy to a quasi-religious mode of perception in which objects are perceived less with the eyes, and more with a symbolic order of social relations:

#+begin_quote
In the same way the light from an object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve, but as the objective form of something outside the eye itself. But, in the act of seeing, there is at all events, an actual passage of light from one thing to another, from the external object to the eye. There is a physical relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities. There, the existence of the things /quâ/ commodities, and the value relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities, have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefrom. There it is a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy, we must have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of the religious world. In that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and and entering into relation both with one another and the human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men's hands. This I call the Fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour, so soon as they are produced as commodities, and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities. [cite:@marx1906capital 83].
#+end_quote

Marx's understanding of commodities relies on a contrast between visual and telic modes. The opposition between, on the one hand, ocular and retinal seeing, and on the other, a fantastic anthromorphization which gives makes objects into "independent beings endowed with life" is one which appears elsewhere in 19th century philosophy, as well. Friedrich Nietzsche, in his early early essay of 1873, "On Truth and Lie in a Nonmoral Sense," argues that objects, as we understand them and discuss them, are anthropomorphizations:

#+begin_quote
If I give a definition of 'mammal' and then, after inspecting a camel, declare, 'Behold, a mammal,' a truth has indeed been brought to light, but one of limited value, by which I mean it is thoroughly anthropomorphic and contains not a single point that would be 'true in itself,' real and universally valid, apart from man. The seeker of such truths seeks at bottom only the metamorphosis of the world into man; he strives for an understanding of the world as a human thing and gains, in the best case, the feeling of an assimilation. [cite:@9780061990465 34–5]
#+end_quote

Since so much of what constitutes the objecthood of a thing is its utility to human beings---its size and shape, whether it can fit in the human hand, whether it can be moved by human beings---it necessarily follows that objecthood is, as Nietzsche argues, an illusion caused by our need for an anthropocentic taxonomy of things.

Meanwhile, Nietzsche's contemporary, Edmund Husserl, outlines a phenomenology of objects in which their anthropomorphic projection is engendered from their sensory qualities: objects are objects, to the degree that they are tactile. Husserl contends that "the originarily presentive act" is "the /material perception/ (perception of physical things), perception of bodies. With this, a basic sort of perception is designated, fully delimited from every other sort of perception" [cite:@husserl1980phenomenology 1]. In a fragment called "the constitutive role of the movement-sensations in comparison with other sensations and the relation between the constitution of animate organism and of physical thing," Husserl argues that "only by means of" the "free acts" in which "an object moves over the skin surface," or "the skin surface of the hand, feeling over it (the object) moves" may we "carry out ... the constitution of physical-thing objects" [cite:@husserl1980phenomenology 108].

A very similar idea may be also found in Henri Bergson, whose /Creative Evolution/ was widely read by modernist writers: "the human intellect feels at home among inanimate objects," he writes, "more especially among solids, where our action finds its fulcrum and our industry its tools" [cite:@bergsonIntroductionMetaphysics1912 21]. The solidity of the object is what distinguishes it from matter.

William James, in a chapter of his 1890 /Principles of Psychology/ called "The Perception of Things," conducts a thought-experiment which highlight the telic/aesthetic dichotomy of thing theory. Looking at a landscape, or a painting, upside-down, he observes, causes the aesthetic experience of it to be richer:

#+begin_quote
Another well-known change is when we look at a landscape with our head upside down. Perception is to a certain extent baffled by this manoeuvre; gradations of distance and other space-determinations are made uncertain; the reproductive or associative processes, in short, decline; and, simultaneously with their diminution, the colors grow richer and more varied, and the contrasts of light and shade more marked. The same thing occurs when we turn a painting bottom upward. We lose much of its meaning, but to compensate for the loss, we feel more freshly the value of the mere tints and shadings, and become  aware of any lack of purely sensible harmony or balance which they may show. [cite:@william_james_principles_1922 81]
#+end_quote

This experiment, of turning a painting on his head, is found in a different form a decade later, in the literary theory of Viktor Shklovsky. In his 1925 theory of defamiliarization, or estrangement, which underpins his theory of descriptions in Tolstoy and other writers, he emphasizes that fresh aesthetic experience of an object happens in negative correlation to its conventional telos, its name, and its taxonomy:

#+begin_quote
The devices by which Tolstoi estranges his material may be boiled down to the following: he does not call a thing by its name, that is, he describes it as if it were perceived for the first time. In addition, he foregoes the conventional names of the various parts of a thing, replacing them instead with the names of corresponding parts in other things. [cite:@shklovsky_theory_1990 6]
#+end_quote

Among modernist writers themselves, we can hear the echos of these contemporaneous object theories, as well. I have already discussed, in chapter 2, Pound's manifesto of /imagisme/, which includes as its first precept "direct treatment of the thing." This is also the aim of the critic, as Walter Pater has it. "'To see the object as in itself it really is,' has been justly said to be the aim of all true criticism whatever," Pater writes, "and in aesthetic criticism the first step towards seeing one's object as it really is, is to know one's own impression as it really is, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly" [cite:@pater1980the xix].

T.S. Eliot's famous critique of /Hamlet/, as is often cited, is that it lacks an "objective correlative," or "a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that /particular/ emotion" [cite:@eliot_waste_2001 120]. This aesthetic is apparent in "The Waste Land" and elsewhere, where emotions like "fear" are perceived through objects like "a handful of dust," and April's cruelty is shown with lilacs. Similarly, Pound's war poem "Hugh Selwyn Mauberly" laments that "there died a myriad," not for patriotism or any other ideology, but "for two gross of broken statues, / for a few thousand battered books," that is, for objects [cite:@PoundSelectedPoems1957 67].

Across the Atlantic, the American modernist poet William Carlos Williams, in the first few stanzas of /Paterson/, writes "say it, no ideas but in things." This is an oft-quoted maxim, but one which deals even more with objecthood in its context: Williams spends the initial passages of his poem anthropomorphizing places and things, particularly the Paterson, New Jersey, of its title. Paterson "lies in the valley under the Passaic Falls / its spent waters forming the outline of his back" [cite:@williams1995paterson 9]. In Williams' reification reverie, Paterson's houses have "blank faces," and his trees are forked by "preconception"; "split, furrowed, creased," as if of a human face.

Max Beerbohm, whose "A Defense of Cosmetics" I discuss in the previous chapter, emerges from the Yellow Nineties with an essay called "Ichabod," published in a 1900 issue of /The Living Age/ in which he describes the collection of travel labels he had accumulated on his hat box [cite:@beerbohm1923yet]. Just as "A Defense" argues, in good aestheticist form, in support of art for art's sake, "Ichabod" celebrates objects for their own sake. This is not quite the things-in-themselves, of the Kantian formulation, nor the neumenon of earlier philosophy, but an aesthetics of the useless. Here, Beerbohm describes the gradual development of the collector, and his collection. It is an aestheticist collection, not of butterfly species, where the goal is to catalogue a genus, or of stamps, where the goal is to have the most rare specimens, but of beautiful things, which are collectible for their own sake:

#+begin_quote
My collection, like most collections, began imperceptibly. A man does not say to himself, 'I am going to collect' this thing or that. True, the schoolboy says so; but his are not, in the true sense of the word, collections. ... It follows that he has no real love of his collection... The sincere collector, how different! His hobby has a solid basis of personal preference. Some one gives him (say) a piece of jade. He admires it. He sees another piece in a shop, and buys it; later, he buys another. He does not regard these pieces of jade as distinct from the rest of his possessions; he has no idea of collecting jade. It is not till he has acquired several other pieces that he ceases to regard them as mere items in the decoration of his room, and gives them a little table, or a tray of a cabinet, all to themselves. How well they look there! How they intensify one another!
... Thus awakes in him, quite gradually, the spirit of the collector. [cite:@beerbohm1923yet 134–5]
#+end_quote

Beerbohm's "sincere collector" collects purely aesthetic objects, which have no purpose other than to be beautiful. He doesn't collect them accidentally, but neither does he collect them purposefully. Rather, he is a /bricoleur/, driven by unseen and unacknowledged forces, creating beauty out of whatever objects happen to be at hand.
# Where to put section on bricolage?

Twenty years later, Virginia Woolf published a short story in /The Athenaeum/ called "Solid Objects" in which the protagonist follows a similar development as a collector, or appreciator of objects [cite:@1920athenaeum]. In this story, much discussed by the critics I cite below, two young men, Charles and John, discuss politics on the beach. But John is distracted by a piece of green sea glass—remarkably jade-like, as we shall see—which Woolf gives a lengthy description, through Charles's eyes. This bears quoting in full, to convey the scope and visuality of the description:

#+begin_quote
When the sand coating was wiped off, a green tint appeared. It was a lump of glass, so thick as to be almost opaque; the smoothing of the sea had completely worn off any edge or shape, so that it was impossible to say whether it had been bottle, tumbler or window-pane; it was nothing but glass; it was almost a precious stone. You had only to enclose it in a rim of gold, or pierce it with a wire, and it became a jewel; part of a necklace, or a dull, green light upon a finger. Perhaps after all it was really a gem; something worn by a dark Princess trailing her finder in the water as she sat in the stern of the boat and listened to the slaves singing as they rowed her across the Bay. Or the oak sides of a sunk Elizabethan treasure-chest had split apart, and, rolled over and over, over and over, its emeralds had come at last to short. John turned it in his hands; he held it to the light; he held it so that its irregular mass blotted out the body and extended right arm of his friend. The green thinned and thickened slightly as it was held against the sky or against the body. It pleased him; it puzzled him; it was so hard, so concentrated, so definite an object compared with the vague sea and the hazy shore. [cite:@1920athenaeum 543]
#+end_quote

This passage is overflowing with objects and artifacts: real, imagined, or metaphorical. Most importantly, however, it is the visuality of these objects which interests Woolf. It is not a sea glass that appears at first, but rather "a green tint." The object doesn't possess the lexically-conditioned archetypal shape of a telic object, such a a "bottle, tumbler or window-pane," and this is what amplifies its visuality. It is "nothing but glass," a fetishized commodity. The extended comparison with a green jewel suggests, of course, jade, thereby updating the aestheticist (or cosmeticist) philosophy of Max Beerboohm's Yellow '90s with the anthropological fetishology of the '10s and '20s. Woolf had certainly read Beerbohm's essays, for in her "The Modern Essay," she praises him as "without a doubt the prince of his profession," and so it is not unlikely that Woolf has Beerbohm's "Ichabod" in mind when she writes "Solid Objects" [cite:@woolf2009selected]. The sea-glass, a seemingly insignificant object, and the refuse of a bygone era, is elevated to the status of a precious gem, once it takes on the social significance that John lends it. Crucially, the aesthetic lens of this glass, also now a literal lens, transforms Charles into a blot, where his body and extended right arm used to be. Instead of the practical, political Charles, there was now a shape: a visual, aesthetic quantity.

Vague shapes of all sorts haunt "Solid Objects." It begins, in a manner which seems to anticipate the birds'-eye helicopter shots of late 20th century cinema: "the only thing that moved upon the vast semi-circle of the beach was one small black spot."[fn::This seems to me strikingly similar to the opening stanza of Wallace Stevens's "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird," which begins, "among twenty snowy mountains / the only moving thing / was the eye of the blackbird." Stevens's poem was published almost three years earlier, in the Chicago-based "little magazine" /Others/. [cite:@others1917 ]] Later, we find that the spot is in fact the outline of the two protagonists. Here again, distance is what makes these people into figures, shapes; only here, it is a physical, rather than psychical, distance. It is only when one of them speaks that they come into focus: the speech act transforms them from aesthetic to pragmatic objects, full of body parts, articles of clothing, and other objects:

#+begin_quote
"Politics be damned!" issued clearly from the body on the left-hand side, and, as these words were uttered, the mouths, noses, chins, little moustaches, tweed caps, rough boots, shooting coats, and check stockings of the two speakers became clearer and clearer; the smoke of their pipes went up into the air; nothing was so solid, so living, so hard, red, hirsute and virile as these two bodies for miles and miles of sea and sandhill. [cite:@1920athenaeum 543]
#+end_quote

"The body on the left-hand side" we later learn is John. But it is also a different left-hand body, since John personifies the left hemisphere of the brain. While Charles, in right-hemispherical style, looks for stones that have practical value (flat stones for skipping), John's interest in them is aesthetic.

Woolf's story continually contrasts these two hemispherical modes, just as she contrasts "hard" and "solid" objects with the airy, smoky, and hazy. Definite objects are the antidote to, and the antagonists of, the politics that John rejects in this passage. Like Beerbohm's collector, who "sees another piece in a shop, and buys it," John "found himself attracted to the windows of curiosity shops when he was out walking, merely because he saw something which reminded him of the lump of glass. Anything, so long as it was an objects of some kind, more or less round, perhaps with a dying flame deep sunk in its mass, anything—china, glass, amber, rock marble—even the smooth oval egg of a prehistoric bird would do" [cite:@1920athenaeum 543]. Eventually, collecting beautiful objects would completely consume him, to the detriment of his career and his friendships.

** Objects in Contemporary Scholarship

The past few decades have also seen a considerable amount of scholarship dealing with modernist literature and its relation to material objects. Douglas Mao's influential 1998 monograph /Solid Objects: Modernism and the Test of Production/, whose name is a reference to Woolf's story, begins with an anecdote about a letter from Freud to H.D., in which the psychoanalyst acknowledges the receipt of flowers, accompanied with a note reading "to greet the return of the Gods." While others in Freud's circle had read "goods," H.D. had actually written "Gods." This "goods/Gods" dichotomy, while anecdotal, becomes for Mao a useful metaphor for literary modernism's struggles with materiality and, if not spirituality, at least, abstraction: the green sea-glass of Woolf's story above, is "definite" as opposed to "the vague sea and the hazy shore" of abstraction.

Mao's centerpiece, as his title suggests, is this story, "Solid Objects." The two men of the story, John and Charles, have the same occupations, but divergent fascinations with shiny things. Mao notes that, for Charles, the utility of the object is its meaning (its /telic hypernymy/, as the WordNet lexicographers will describe this relation, in the section below)---Charles would rather find a stone to skip over the water, rather than one to admire, as John would. John's aestheticism, Mao points out, is Paterian, aligned with Pater's dictum, "not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end."

# More here on /Solid Objects/

Tracing object theories in philosophy, from Kant and Hegel through the Frankfurt School, Mao argues, as I do in this chapter, that the 20th Century sees a palpable change in the way we treat objects: "... one of the swerves (if not the break) of our own century is to be found in a new return to objects, now held to illuminate not only the order of the cosmos or distant antiquity but also the immediate human past" [cite:@mao_solid_1998 6]. Mao cites the object as a fulcrum at which the epistemological problems of modernity collide: "the object could hold a privileged place within certain readings of modernity in part because modernity could be construed as an affair of consciousness gone awry, a phenomenon of subjectivity grown rapacious and fantastically powerful either with the help of or under the sway of science and expansionist capitalism" [cite:@mao_solid_1998 8].

Bill Brown, one of the most visible scholars of object studies, also writes extensively about this story of Woolf's. His 1999 article, "The Secret Life of Things," employs William James's chapter quoted above, to differentiate between /things/ and /objects/: "what I want to underscore is how in James the difference between the apperceptive constitution of the thing, in what I would call its /objecthood/, and the experience of a thing, in what I would call its /thinghood/, emerges in the moment (and no doubt only as a moment) of reobjectification that is a kind of misuse---turning the picture bottom up, standing on one's head" [cite:@brown1999secret 6]. In Brown, objectification of things happens along the axis of perception: there is a negative correlation between an object's visual properties---its colors and shapes---and its recognition, its digitization and lexicalization.

Brown's 2004 edited collection of object theory essays, /Things/, begins by expanding on the distinction between /things/ and /objects/. Objects are things that have taken on the grammatical quality of their syntactic namesakes. Things, on the other hand, exist outside of grammar, action, and abstraction: they are "something warm, that relieves us from the chill of dogged ideation, something concrete that relieves us from unnecessary abstraction" [cite:@brownThings2004 1]. Brown expands further on this object theory in 2016's /Other Things/, where he argues that subject and object are engendered by things: "some thing, by which I will always mean the thingness of the constituted object, is the outcome of an interaction (beyond their mutual constitution) between subject and object" [cite:@brown2016other 22].

# Something more here

The cultural critic Jean Baudrillard, in /The System of Objects/, observes the proliferation of objects in our world of mass production, arguing that "our urban civilization is witness to an ever-accelerating procession of generations of product, appliances and gadgets" [cite:@baudrillard2020system 3]. In the 18th century, he contends, these could be systematically catalogued in, for example, Diderot's /Encyclopédie/. But lately, "everyday objects ... proliferate, needs multiply, production speeds up the life-span of such objects—yet we lack the vocabulary to name them all" [cite:@baudrillard2020system 3].

More recently, there has been even more interest in this field. In 2018, John Stout's /Objects Observed: the Poetry of Things in Twentieth-Century France and America/, traces objects in the poetic works of, among others, Pound, Zukofsky, Oppen, and Stevens, on the American side, and Mallarmé, Rimbaud, Appollinaire, Breton, Ponge, and Tortel, on the French, narrating the evolution of object, objectification, and desire through movements such as /imagisme/, /surréalisme,/ cubism, and objectivism  [cite:@stout_objects_2018]. Susan Sachon's 2020 /Shakespeare, Objects and Phenomenology/ reads /Macbeth/, /King Lear/, and /Titus Andronicus/ in terms of their objects and bodies, using methods from phenomenologists such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty [cite:@sachon_shakespeare_2020]. Jörg Kreienbrock, his his 2013 /Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature/ treats "bad objects": malfunctioning or hindering objects, in Lawrence Sterne and others [cite:@kreienbrock_malicious_2013].

One of the more daring hypotheses in the field comes from Pierre Laszlo's 1993 essay "La Leçon de Choses." Speaking of French literature between 1870 and 1940 and its images, he asks, "Where do these images come from?" and answers, "They are rooted in the 'lessons from things' (leçons de choses) that the writer received in primary school; ... These lessons gave our authors a talent for accurate, painstaking observation. It gave them also an enduring, pleasurable taste for naming" [cite:@laszloLecon  275]. I am inclined to agree with the pedagogical origin of objects as words and concepts, but this is also true of language itself.

Object theory, as it is known in these various disciplines, provide in some cases historical claims, /chez/ Marx, Benjamin, and Mao, that modernity represents a break in our understanding of objects. Modernist literature, then, struggles with this break, and its challenges for aesthetic representation. The questions that remain, and which we will model with computational analysis, are not merely whether objects become a particular concern of modernism, or even the degree to which they do, but the /how/ and the /why/: the ways in which these phenomenological / grammatical processes are enacted. In the sections below, I quantify these trends in 20th century literature, with attention to these modes of operation.

* Experiment: Quantifying Objects in Literature

This experiment quantifies the comparative presence of objects in British fiction and poetry. I want to know: what are the objects that are the most common? Which fall in and out of favor, over time? Which are incommensurate with lived experience? Of those objects, how many are natural objects, and how many are artificial? To do this, I apply techniques of word sense disambiguation to $C_{PG}$ $C_{CL}$, and others, and quantify the results using the Princeton WordNet. Since the results of this experiment are so dependent on its design, it's necessary to describe each of the elements of this algorithm, first, beginning with WordNet and word sense disambiguation.

** WordNet

In computational linguistics, the most-used lexical relation database is the Princeton WordNet [cite:@miller1995wordnet; @miller1998wordnet]. As its name implies, WordNet is more than a machine-readable dictionary, or thesaurus, although it is both of those, but it is a network of relations between words. In the creators' own term, WordNet represents a particular theory of /componential semantics/: an agglutinative form of lexicography. "Componential semantics approaches the meaning of a word," WordNet contributor George A. Miller writes, "in much the same way as it approaches the meaning of a sentence: the meaning of a sentence should be decomposable into the meanings of its constituents, and the meaning of a word should be similarly decomposable into certain semantic primitives, or conceptual atoms" [cite:@miller1998wordnet xvi].

The basic unit of WordNet is the /synset/: a "lexicalized concept of English," or "a set of synonyms that can be used (in an appropriate context) to express that concept" [cite:@miller1998wordnet 24]. Synsets are denoted in WordNet according to one of their lemmas, its part of speech, and its sense number, with the most common sense given the lowest number. So the first sense of the lemma /robin/, whose definition in WordNet is the "small Old World songbird with a reddish breast," is denoted =robin.n.01=.

WordNet charts relations between synsets in terms of their hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy, and more. For the purposes of this experiment, I will largely be exploring hypernymic and hyponymic relations. Hypernymy encompasses a variety of lexical supersets, of which one is taxonomic. A hypernym tree for =robin.n.01=, for instance, may be =robin.n.01= @-> =thrush.n.03= @-> =oscine.n.01= @-> =passerine.n.01= @-> =bird.n.01= @-> =vertebrate.n.01= @-> =chordate.n.01= @-> =animal.n.01= @-> =organism.n.01= @-> =living_thing.n.01= @-> =whole.n.02= @-> =object.n.01= @-> =physical_entity.n.01= @-> =entity.n.01/,= where @-> denotes a hypernymic relation.

However, taxonomies like this can be technical, as the WordNet creators freely admit. An English speaker without a specialized education in biological taxonomy will likely describe a robin as a bird, but unlikely describe it as a passerine. Furthermore, taxonomy is but one of several varieties of hypernymy. As Anna Wierzbicka and others have shown, apples are not just a "kind of fruit," but a food: nouns have telic hypernymy, as well [cite:@wierzbicka1984apples]. So hypernymic relations in WordNet are not a simple hierarchy, like those found in 18th century encyclopedias. Rather, they are a "tangled hierarchy," or a directed graph of lexical relations [cite:@miller1998wordnet 35].

Taxonomies like those in WordNet are useful, even if they diverge from our intuition. If we can suspend disbelief long enough to understand that these overlapping categories are opinions, then we can apply these taxonomies to a text, to derive a picture of the text's categories. I employ WordNet for this study, rather than, say, the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary, since it is easily machine-readable, has a well-documented interface in the Python NLTK, has a long history of expansion and revision, since the 1990s, and catalogs a wide variety of semantic relations.[fn::See [cite:@heuser_quantitative_2012] for an example of an analysis which uses the Historical Thesaurus of the OED.]

In this first experiment, my goal is to find the objects of a literary text. What constitutes an object is difficult to define, as we have seen in the object theory section above, so to systematize this query, I identify any WordNet sense which has as one of its hypernyms, ~object.n.1~, defined as "a tangible and visible entity; an entity that can cast a shadow" [cite:@wordnet:object]. The synset /object.n.1/ itself has 37 direct hyponyms, which include a number of oddly specific synsets: =keepsake.n.01=, =curio.n.01=, =hoodoo.n.04=, and =je_ne_sais_quoi.n.01=, all synsets which appear to be difficult to categorize. But there is a much larger set of hyponyms of =object.n.01='s hyponym =whole.n.02=. The direct hyponyms of =whole.n.02=, shown in [cite:@tbl:wholeHyponyms], read as categories.


#+CAPTION: Hyponyms of =whole.n.02=
#+LABEL: tbl:wholeHyponyms
| Synset                | Definition                                                                |
|-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =artifact.n.01=       | a man-made object taken as a whole                                        |
| =assembly.n.05=       | a unit consisting of components that have been fitted together            |
| =congener.n.03=       | a whole (a thing or person) of the same kind or category as another       |
| =item.n.03=           | a whole individual unit; especially when included in a list or collection |
| =living_thing.n.01=   | a living (or once living) entity                                          |
| =natural_object.n.01= | an object occurring naturally; not made by man                            |
| =sum.n.05=            | the whole amount                                                          |

These are not strictly categories, however, since a given synset may have more than one of these as hypernyms: a horse may be both a natural objects ("not made by man"), and a living thing. Given that =assembly.n.05=, =congener.n.03=, =item.n.03=, and =sum.n.05= have relatively shallow hyponym trees, I will mostly be focusing on the proportions of words in literary texts with the hypernyms =artifact.n.01=, =living_thing.n.01=, and =natural_object.n.01=.

** Word Sense Disambiguation

The problem of computationally analyzing a text's objects requires that it can correctly identify those objects. To do that, the computer program must first be able to discern between many different senses of a word. If we are to ascertain whether a given instance of /bank/ is a natural object (a river bank), we must first ensure that it is not a financial institution. In computational linguistics, this problem is known as word sense disambiguation, or WSD, and it has been one of the hardest problems for natural language processing over the past fifty years.

The problem is at least as old as 1949, when Warren Weaver, a computer scientist working on machine translation, wrote:

#+begin_quote
If one examines the words in a book, one at a time through an opaque mask with a hole in it one word wide, then it is obviously impossible to determine, one at a time, the meaning of words. “Fast” may mean “rapid”; or it may mean “motionless”; and there is no way of telling which. But, if one lengthens the slit in the opaque mask, until one can see not only the central word in question but also say N words on either side, then, if N is large enough one can unambiguously decide the meaning. [cite:@weaver1955translation 20]
#+end_quote

At various points in the 20th Century, effective WSD was considered an intractable problem. For example, referring to the phrase "the box is in the pen," Bar-Hillel argued, in 1960, that "no existing or imaginable program will enable an electronic computer to determine that the word 'pen' is used in its ‘enclosure’ sense in the passage ... because of the need to model, in general, all world knowledge like, for example, the relative sizes of objects" [cite:@agirre2007; quoted in; p. 5-6].

However, the field has seen much advancement over the years. One of the first WSD algorithms is the Lesk Algorithm, developed by Michael Lesk, of Bell Communications Research, in 1987 [cite:@lesk86_autom]. In its original form, this algorithm disambiguates between senses by comparing the definitions of the context words. Lesk's own example presents the problem of guessing whether /ash/ refers to the tree or the remains of a fire. If it appears in the phrase /coal ash,/ one could compare the sense definitions for /coal/ and for /ash/. Since one sense of /ash/ has the definition "the solid residue left when combustible material is fully burned," and one sense of /coal/ has the definition "a black or brownish solid combustible substance," we can determine that the two senses align by their overlapping definition word /combustible./

Since the 80s, there have been some minor improvements to WSD, but which are mainly variations of the Lesk algoritm: simplified Lesk, adapted Lesk, and so on [cite:@banerjee2002]. Yet only in the past couple of years have WSD algorithms attained an accuracy greater than 80%. The one I employ here is EWISER, "Enhanced WSD Integrating Synset Embeddings and Relations." This is among the first to, as the title of their paper puts it, to "break through the 80% glass ceiling" [cite:@bevilacqua-navigli-2020-breaking].

EWISER is a neural net trained on SemCor, a sense-tagged corpus, and uses glosses and examples from WordNet. Even though EWISER uses a probabilistic model, and therefore obviates the need for a Lesk-style computation, disambiguating each word in a text is an extremely expensive operation, computationally. Disambiguating a single text in $C_{PG}$ takes around 20 minutes on an Intel i7 CPU. It runs much faster on the university's cluster computing servers, however, and much faster on GPUs, and so I employed a node with 24 GPU cores and 96GB of RAM, which even when running in parallel across all cores, got through an analysis of $C_{PG2}$ in about ten days.

** Results and Discussion
*** Literary-historical trends

Objects appear much more frequently in the modernist literary period. [cite:@Fig:object-proportions] shows the proportions of all objects over time in $C_{PG2}$: the number of words with =object.n.01= hypernyms, divided by the total number of words in a text. An ordinary least squares linear regression on this data set shows that there is an 11.4% increase in objects from texts published in 1800, to texts published in 1920.

#+INCLUDE: "04-shapes/includes/object_proportions.html" export html

#+CAPTION: Object proportions over time, $C_{PG2}$
#+LABEL: fig:object-proportions
[[./images/dummy.png]]

These trends look very different when we examine object hyponyms, however. The hyponym =living_thing.n.01= decreases in proportion by about 8% over this same 1800–1920 period, as shown in [cite:@fig:livingThing]. However, the =natural_object.n.01= hyponym increases by a smaller 7%, ([cite:@fig:naturalObject]), and =artifact.n.01= increases by 15% ([cite:@fig:artifact]).

A number of factors may help to explain the rise in object proportions, in the fiction and poetry of this period. First, as Baudrillard argues above, mass production of consumer goods makes artifacts much more common. At the same time, a diversification of mass-produced goods creates new words to describe new gadgets. Urbanization may account, in part, for the decline in =living_thing.n.01= hyponyms: if more people live in cities, statistically, than in the country, fiction may be more likely to take place in cities, where encounters with (non-human) living things may be less common than in the country. But ultimately, I attribute most of this rise to a change in the way modernist writers /see/.

The hypernym =artifact.n.01= refers to a wide variety of objects. The most frequent hyponyms include =door.n.01= and =doorway.n.01=, =window.n.01=, =room.n.01=, =ship.n.01=, =layer.n.01=, =floor.n.02=, =house.n.01=, =road.n.01=, =table.n.02=, =dwelling.n.01=, =letter.n.01=, =door.n.04=, and =step.n.04=. Many of these are domestic words which may help to set a scene, or begin a description of a location.

*** Texts with the most objects

[cite:@Tbl:objects] shows the texts with the higest proportions of objects. Most of these are children's books: /Peacock Pie/, /Songs of Childhood/, and /Down-Adown-Derry/, by Walter de la Mare; and /Oswald Bastable/, /The Story of the Amulet/, and /The Wouldbegoods/, by Edith Nesbit, and /A Child's Garden of Verses/, by Robert Louis Stevenson. Here again, there is a pronounced visuality in juvenile fiction and poetry, which suggests that visual attention to the world is either known as a childlike state of mind, or in some other way expected of children's literature.

All of these were published squarely within the 1880–1930 period I am using as a proxy for literary modernism, but four were published in 1922, specifically---"the year that changed literature" according to Goldstein, and "modernism year one," according to Jackson: both subtitles of monographs about the year's literary import [cite:@goldstein17;@jackson2013constellation].

One book, Richard Jefferies's /Round About a Great Estate/, is not exactly a work of fiction, but an exemplar of literary nonfiction nature writing. The presence of this book among the other works of fiction and poetry here suggests that nature writing may explain much of the object proportions here. Nature writing is not only a category of book, of course, but a writing style, and passages of ecological description, in all its forms, may certainly be found in the other works here. Notably, /The Garden Party and Other Stories/, whose titular story features an abundance of nature description. The other works here are canonical modernist texts: two by Katherine Mansfield, /Ulysses/ by James Joyce, and /Jacob's Room/, Virginia Woolf's novel.

When we turn to the hyponyms of =object.n.01=, we see most of these texts, although in slightly different orders. The text with the largest proportions of the hyponym =living_thing.n.01= is the Jefferies book listed above, /Round About a Great Estate/. Then, there are the usual suspects of children's literature, this time also including children's poetry from Edward Lear, and children's stories by Rudyard Kipling. But also found here are two short works of nature writing by Mary Russell Mitford, an ecological novel from Mayne Reid, and poetry collections from the highly nature-oriented poets Thomas Hood and John Clare.

The hyponyms of =natural_object.n.01= show a similar cast of characters. Here, we find at the lead another Kipling work, /An Almanac of Twelve Sports/, a very short book of light rhymes which accompany a set of illustrations from William Nicholson. Although there is not a preponderance of natural objects, the total number of words is so small as to make the meager number of occurrences a decent proportion of the total. Here, for instance, is one of the twelve poems:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Fishing.

Behold a parable! A fished for B.
C took her bait; her heart was set on D.
Thank Heaven, who cooled your blood and cramped your wishes,
Men and not Gods torment you, little fishes.
#+END_VERSE

Although /fishes/ is really the only word which qualifies as a natural object, the length of the poem is such that it is given more significance. With this in mind, we might want to treat with more skepticism the frequencies of objects in poems.

Are the childrens' poems collections just so short that they are more likely to have large proportions of objects? Or is there some affinity between children's poetry and modernist fiction?

/The Happy Foreigner/ is Enid Bagnold's first novel, narrating her experiences of being a driver during the first world war. Consider the beginning passages of the novel:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The war had stopped.

The King of England was in Paris, and the President of the United States was hourly expected.

Humbler guests poured each night from the termini into the overflowing city, and sought anxiously for some bed, lounge-chair, or pillowed corner, in which to rest until the morning. Stretched upon the table in a branch of the Y.W.C.A. lay a young woman from England whose clothes were of brand-new khaki, and whose name was Fanny.
#+END_QUOTE

This passage is littered with artifacts: railway termini, the city, a beg, a lounge-chair, a pillow, the corner of a room, a table, and Fanny's clothes.

And here is a passage from Katherine Mansfield's story "At the Bay," which begins her volume /The Garden Party and Other Stories/.

#+begin_quote
Very early morning. The sun was not yet risen, and the whole of Crescent Bay was hidden under a white sea-mist. The big bush-covered hills at the back were smothered. You could not see where they ended and the paddocks and bungalows began. The sandy road was gone and the paddocks and bungalows the other side of it; there were no white dunes covered with reddish grass beyond them; there was nothing to mark which was beach and where was the sea. A heavy dew had fallen. The grass was blue. Big drops hung on the bushes and just did not fall; the silvery, fluffy toi-toi was limp on its long stalks, and all the marigolds and the pinks in the bungalow gardens were bowed to the earth with wetness. Drenched were the cold fuchsias, round pearls of dew lay on the flat nasturtium leaves. It looked as though the sea had beaten up softly in the darkness, as though one immense wave had come rippling, rippling—how far? Perhaps if you had waked up in the middle of the night you might have seen a big fish flicking in at the window and gone again....
[cite:@mansfield_garden_1998]
#+end_quote

The sun, the sea-mist, the bush, the paddocks, the bungalows, the sand, the dunes, the grass, the beach, the sea, the dew, the grass, the bushes, the /toi-toi/, the marigolds, the pinks, the earth, the fuchsias, the leaves, the waves, the fish, and the window: an abundance of living things, natural objects, and artifacts.

/Ulysses/ is also famous for some of its catalogs of artifacts. Told in the style of a Christian catechism, the "Ithaca" episode represents the height of this mode. Here, Leopold Bloom lists the things on his mantelpiece, all of which are wedding presents.

#+begin_quote
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?

A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.

What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?

In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle. [cite:@joyce_ulysses_1986 581]
#+end_quote

The three objects, an animal (owl), a vegetable (dwarf tree), and a mineral (marble clock), are all keepsakes, souvenirs.  The "interchanges of looks" personify the objects, at least two of which indeed have faces (the clock face and the owl's face). They are not geometrically, but economically homothetic, and they serve no purpose other than to remind the couple of their marriage. This makes a stark contrast to a later list of objects, which serves to remind Bloom of his wife's recent infidelity:

#+begin_quote
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?

New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.
#+end_quote

The trinity of objects here—the bedlinen, crumbs, and potted meat—is the inverse of the previous trinity. Instead of decorative objects with no purpose, they are all objects with a definite purpose, and they are clues which show what has been happening there just before: sex and snacking.

*** Texts with the fewest objects

At the other end of the spectrum are texts with low proportions of objects. These are worth discussing, insofar as they illuminate what the object count here is measuring. /Lady Susan/, Jane Austen's posthumously published epistolary novel, ranks as the work with the fewest hyponyms of =object.n.01= [cite:@austen_lady]. Published in 1871, but probably written in 1794, it details the exploits of Lady Susan Vernon---marriage plots and otherwise---in her letters and others'. Consider the opening paragraph of the novel:

#+begin_quote
MY DEAR BROTHER,—I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of profiting by your kind invitation when we last parted of spending some weeks with you at Churchhill, and, therefore, if quite convenient to you and Mrs. Vernon to receive me at present, I shall hope within a few days to be introduced to a sister whom I have so long desired to be acquainted with. My kind friends here are most affectionately urgent with me to prolong my stay, but their hospitable and cheerful dispositions lead them too much into society for my present situation and state of mind; and I impatiently look forward to the hour when I shall be admitted into your delightful retirement. [cite:@austen_lady]
#+end_quote

This epistolary fragment traffics in emotion: pleasure, profit, desire, hospitality, cheerfulness, delight; and in social relations: invitation, introduction, acquaintence, affection, friends, and society. The focus is the relation between people, rather than the relations between objects, or those between objects and people. Not a single object appears in this letter, or in the several that follow.

Austen's /Pride and Prejudice/, another marriage-plot novel, appears at the twelfth spot in this list [cite:@austen_pride_2013]. Following that is Fanny Burney's final novel, /The Wanderer; or, Female Difficulties/ [cite:@burney_wanderer], about a woman who flees the France of the Reign of Terror, only to arrive in England poor and friendless, and /Kept in the Dark/ [cite:@trollope_kept_2007], an Anthony Trollope marriage-plot novel.

The presence of so many marriage-plot novels here, and those bearing the Library of Congress subject heading "Domestic Fiction," suggests that these narratives negatively correlate with the presence of objects. If the primary focus of a literary work is interpersonal relationships, it seems that this occludes the presence of object details, descriptions, and other correlating visual phenomena.

* Bodies

The human body is not only a special type of object, but in one sense, its archetype. The synonymy of /body/ with /object/, in its sense of /celestial bodies,/ hints at a lexical relation between the senses which extends beyond mere meronymy. In fact, this sense of /body/ is defined by the OED lexicographers as "a material thing, an object" [cite:@oed:body]. Like celestial bodies, human bodies are of course objects, although this distinction, in English, carries with it a certain anxiety. The frequencies of bigrams like /inanimate object/ suggest the necessity of differentiating between living bodies and other types of objects. And the use of bodies or body parts as objects, grammatically or physically, is often referred to as /objectification/, and carries with it an implication of dehumanization. Thus, it is unsurprising that referring to a person as "a body" generally means that the person is dead---has become a /corpse/, a word of course etymologically derived from /corpus,/ body.

To say that a person is a body is to imply that they're /just/ a body, that is, that their mind or soul has left their body, leaving them with only part of their whole person. But since modern neuroscience now understands the mind, and indeed the soul, to be functions of the brain, they are therefore always already body. The collapse, in the science and philosophy of the 19th century, of the Cartesian mind/body distinction, along with other Judeo-Christian dualistic thinking, means that there is no mind, no soul, /but in body/. Just as Derrida famously declared that "il n'y a pas de hors-texte," there is a sense in which, phenomenologically speaking, there is nothing outside the body.

/Body/, as with /object/, implies a unity which is not found in matter or substance. To cut up the body into its constituent parts, conceptually or grammatically, is to dissociate it from the holistic self. Attention or fixation on individual body parts, then, with disregard for the holistic body, often connotes a sexual fixation which ignores the whole person. In Binet's foundational work on sexual fetishism, quoted above, he provides a taxonomy of paraphilias as "1. l'amant de l'œil; 2. l'amant de la main; 3. l'amant des cheveux; 4. l'amant de l'odeur" [cite:@binet1887fétichisme 146]. The first three of these are body parts. Binet understandably treats these paraphilias as mental illnesses, but a focus on body parts is a necessary effect of language. Despite the deep interdependence of each bodily organ, and the impossibility of organs to live apart from the body (a severed arm is never called "Jim"), the division of a body into parts is a necessary topography, and taxonomy, which aids medicine, aids our understanding of ourselves, and of course allows us to speak about our bodies, and those of others, using words.

In this way, we cannot escape the anxiety caused by the objectification / lexicalization of body parts. I may say that I have an eye in just the same way that I have a book, but with my eye, it's different: I /am/ the eye, just as I am the rest of my body. I have two arms, yet what I am includes two arms. So the boundary between /has/ and /is/ begins to dissolve on the level of the body part or organ.

#+begin_comment
Fragmentation of the body
 - Orts, scraps, fragments
#+end_comment

Freud's psychology, which builds off of Binet's, expands the fetishism of the body to include sexual predilections for clothes and other para-corporeal accoutrements. His 1899 /Interpretation of Dreams/ relies heavily on lexical ambiguity to show how bodily anxieties of various kinds manifest themselves in dreams. In one case, one of Freud's patients asks her husband whether they should have the piano tuned, but concludes "it is not worth while" [cite:@freud1999interpretation 250]. She later calls the piano a "disgusting chest" and grasps at her jacket, which was missing a button. Freud explains that this means she is ashamed of her own chest (breasts), and thinks of her own chest "don't look, it is not worth while." The ambiguity in /chest/, then, both an artifact and a body part, is the fulcrum at which, for Freud, one's sexual embarrassments are encoded.

So the human body is an object, in more than one sense, but is rarely discussed in critical studies of objects in modernism. Instead, a rich body of critical work concerns "the body in literature." And in those corporeal studies, inanimate objects are rarely discussed. So bodies and objects are sometimes synonyms, sometimes antonyms, and only rarely part-meronyms.

In the introduction to their 2015 /Cambridge Companion to the Body in Literature/, editors David Hillman and Ulrika Maude trace an intellectual history of literary corporeality which begins with Michel Foucault, is threaded through feminist theorists like Hélène Cixous and Luce Irigaray, and is dealt with in the cultural theories of Frederic Jameson and Jean Baudrillard, as well as the socio-cultural anthropology of Pierre Bourdieu and Marcel Mauss [cite:@hillman2015cambridge 2]. The body in literature is, in these lenses, discursively produced through institutional power, gendered concepts, and images of the body. The essays in this volume deal with disability, obesity, maternality, sexuality, pain, violence, death, and other aspects of the body in literature.

These subfields of body studies carry significant traditions of scholarship, as well. There is a tradition which deals with pain, torture, and the political subjection of bodies: Foucault's /Discipline and Punish/ charts a history of torture, and arrives at a theory of prisons and panopticism and Elaine Scarry's /The Body in Pain/ deals with the inexpressability of pain, and the difficulties that arise from it [cite:@foucault2012discipline; @9780195049961]. Studies of maternal bodies are also becoming common: Cristina Mazzoni's 2002 /Maternal Impressions/, for instance [cite:@mazzoni2002maternal].

# Several monographs on death ageing have been published recently, as well

In modernist studies, as well, the body has become an increasing axis of inquiry, as well as with objects. Peter Brooks's /Body Work: Objects of Desire in Modern Narrative/ connects the intimacies of novels, and the experiences of reading them, through conditions such as privacy. It begins, "the rise of the novel is closely tied to the rise of the idea of privacy. The condition of privacy characterizes the reading and writing of novels. Perhaps as a consequence of this private production and consumption, private life was from the inception of the genre the novel's subject matter as well—or perhaps it was the other way around: the need to explore the relatively new concept of private experience entailed the invention of the novel" [cite:@9780674077249 28].

James Joyce, as a young man, briefly attended medical school with aspirations to become a doctor [cite:@ellmann_james_1982 105–107]. The schemata for /Ulysses/, in which Joyce explains the structure of the novel, /ex post facto/, to his friends and aspiring reviewers, includes a column for organ correspondences: each chapter, beginning with the fourth, has a corresponding organ of the human body. "Calypso," the fourth episode, has "kidney" listed as the corresponding organ, and it is there that we find Leopold Bloom, who "ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls," preparing to eat a kidney [cite:@joyce_ulysses_1986 45]. "Aeolus," named after the god of the wind, takes place at a windy newspaper office, and has as its organ the lungs. And "Nausicaa," the chapter which arguably got /Ulysses/ banned, in which Bloom stares at Gertie Mcdowell and pleasures himself, has as its dual organs the eye and the nose.

Maud Ellman has catalogued many of these correspondences in /Ulysses/, which she calls, following Joyce's pronouncement, "the epic of the human body" [cite:@ellmann2008ulysses]. In "More Kicks Than Pricks: Modernist Body Parts," she argues that "a continuation of war by other means, art explodes the illusion of bodily integrity, reducing it to splintered body-parts" [cite:@ellmannKicks 254]. We might take this even further, and say that language itself splinters the body into parts.

Christine Froula, in /Modernisms's Body: Sex, Culture, and Joyce/, argues that Joyce uses his "resisting artists' suffering, transgressions, symptoms, masquerade, parody, creativity, and play," often along sexual or somatic axes, to "turn the perversity of which he is often accused into a daring critique of his culture" [cite:@froula1996modernism xi].

Most of these studies, as with the modernist object studies above, in some way suggest that the modern period shows a renewed attention to the body, and to embodied experiences, whether via changing social mores surrounding representations of sex, as evidenced by the obscenity trials of /Ulysses/ and /Lady Chatterly's Lover/, or through more complex changes in the climate of thought which recast experience as necessarily embodied. All this leads me to questions which might be testable by computational analysis. For instance, to what extent /does/ the literature of the early 20th century become concerned with the corporeal?

* Experiment: Bodies in Literature

How, and to what extent, does the literature of the early 20th century become corporeal? Do the bodies of literary characters become more legible, at the turn of the century, or less? How, precisely, do these bodies appear in fiction? What body parts are the foci of character descriptions? To answer these questions, I turn again to word sense disambiguation, with EWISER and WordNet, but search for hyponyms of =body_part.n.01=. This largely filters out any use of body parts as metaphors, which could, in more naive analyses, have accounted for most of the instances of given words. For instance, /heart/ as center should not be considered synonymous with /heart/, the organ, just as /hand/, help, as in, to give one a hand, should not be considered the same as the body part. I then aggregate the results, and divide by the total number of words in a text.

[cite:@Fig:bodyPartDiachronic] shows the proportions of body parts per text, by year of publication, along with a line representing the ordinary least squares, modeling the chronological trend. Between 1800 and 1920, there is a 63% increase in the proportions of body parts in these texts.

** The Most and Least Corporeal Texts

The texts with the highest proportions of =body_part.n.01= hyponyms are shown in [cite:@tbl:bodyParts]. At the top of the list is the Victorian erotic novel /The Romance of Lust/, published anonymously, but rumored to have been written by William Simpson Potter and others of his coterie. Lisa Sigel describes it as "one of the most expensive pieces of Victorian pornography, costing upward of £10 in 1892, one of the longest at over 600 pages, and one of the best-known pieces of the period (running second place to /My Secret Life/ in all categories)" [cite:@sigel2006 1048].

Following that are three works by Joan Conquest, a largely forgotten novelist of the early 20th Century, formerly a nurse during the first world war, who writes chiefly in the genre of fantasy romance. Set in India and Egypt, these are novels which use their Eastern locales as means towards rich description, of bodies and setting. Here again, we see socio-cultural distance as a correlation with the presence of objects and bodies.

Also present here are two novels by Ford Madox Ford, /The Fifth Queen/ and /Privy Seal/, which belong, with /The Fifth Queen Crowned/ to a trilogy of historical romances based on the life of Catherine Howard, the fifth wife of Henry VIII. The novels, which Conrad called "the swan song of Historical Romance," contain rich bodily descriptions [cite:@ford_fifth_1984 v].
The introduction by A.S. Byatt, in a 1984 edition of the novel, cites its impressionistic style, and calls it "highly visual" [cite:@ford_fifth_1984 vii]. Consider this passage, describing Lady Mary:

#+begin_quote
The lady stood, rigid and straight, her hands clasped before her. Her face, pale so that not even a touch of red showed above the cheekbones and hardly any in the tightly-pursed lips, was as if framed in her black hood that fastened beneath the chin. The high, narrow forehead had the hair tightly drawn back so that none was visible, and the coif that showed beneath the hood was white, like a nun's; the temples were hollowed so that she looked careworn inexpressibly, and her lips had hard lines around them. Above her head all sounds in that dim room seemed to whisper for a long time among the rafters as if here dwelt something mysterious, sepulchral, a great grief or a great passion. [cite:@ford_fifth_1984]
#+end_quote

Here, Ford describes Lady Mary's demeanor using her posture---her body language---rather than abstractions, or emotion words. She is "rigid" and "tight" in her personality, as we later learn, but the "tightly" we find twice in this description, is in her lips and hair.

Ford's friend Joseph Conrad also makes this list, with the novels /Gaspar Ruiz/ and /The Nigger of the Narcissus/. The titular character of /Gaspar Ruiz/ is a strongman, often described bodily:

#+begin_quote
That voice, senores, proceeded from the head of Gaspar Ruiz. Of his body I could see nothing. Some of his fellow-captives had clambered upon his back. He was holding them up. His eyes blinked without looking at me. That and the moving of his lips was all he seemed able to manage in his overloaded state. And when I turned round, this head, that seemed more than human size resting on its chin under a multitude of other heads, asked me whether I really desired to quench the thirst of the captives. [cite:@conradGasparRuiz]
#+end_quote

Here, we learn of Gaspar's strong back, unblinking eyes, lips, oversized head, and chin. It is not Gaspar himself that looks, but "his eyes." And it is not Gaspar who speaks to this chapter's narrator, General Santierra, but "this head." As in "Solid Objects," where the two men first appear as "one small black spot," the visuality of bodily descriptions comes first.

The texts with the least hyponyms of =body_part.n.01=, shown in [cite:@tbl:bodyPartsLow], is similar to that of other objects. After removing non-fiction works erroneously categorized here, the result is largely a list of Victorian romances. Jane Austen figures heavily here, where again /Lady Susan/ is a low-ranking text, as it was for other objects. /Pride and Prejudice/, /Mansfield Park/, and /Emma/ follow.

To better understand the comparative acorporeality of an Austen novel, consider this physical character description of Elizabeth from /Pride and Prejudice/, one of its more corporeal passages:

#+begin_quote
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. [cite:@austen_pride_2013]
#+end_quote

While there are some body parts present here, "face" and "eyes" are the only explicit ones, and it is only "her dark eyes" that are the real body parts, since "eyes" means instead "opinion," in the expression "in the eyes of his friend." Similarly, "form" and "figure," while describing her body, are more abstract bodily attributes. So where there is a description of Elizabeth's body, it is rather a means, a vehicle, for describing her "uncommonly intelligent" appearance. For Austen, the body is a mode of perceiving character and personality. Unlike in Conrad and Ford, Austen's bodily descriptions are merely waystaytions to abstractions and emotions.

** Distribution of Body Parts

Next, I wanted to measure which body parts are the most common in the fiction and poetry of this period. [cite:@Fig:bodyPartSums] shows the total proportions of various body parts, as they appear in $C_{PG2}$. Again, what is shown here is not the original word forms, but their synsets. The synset =hand.n.01= is by far the most common, at 20% of the total number of body parts; =eye.n.01= is next most common, at almost 12%; and the subsequent body parts are all smaller by degrees: =face.n.01= at almost 7%, =head.n.01= at around 5%, =arm.n.01= and =shoulder.n.01= at around 3%, and =finger.n.01=, =lip.n.01=, =back.n.01=, and =foot.n.01= around 2%. These numbers will come of use later, as I compare them to neurological findings, in the section below.

The larger the dot on this image of a body, the larger the proportion of the corresponding body part's appearances. The conclusion one draws from this visualization is that the hand and the face are undoubtedly the centra of attention, while the torso and leg are comparatively neglected.

This distribution is seemingly borne out in the literary scholarship, as well. In Peter Capuano's 2015 /Changing Hands/, he argues that "major changes unique to the nineteenth century made hands newly relevant, and that this new relevance reconfigured the hand's relationship to the body in ways that shaped just about every contour of the Victorian novel" [cite:@capuano2015changing 1]. Capuano followed this with the 2020 edited volume, /Victorian Hands,/ subtitled, /The Manual Turn in Nineteenth-Century Body Studies/, where he introduces the volume by arguing "hands are a compelling subject for working through the ongoing critical impasse between constructivism and materialism. The constructivist tendency is to fold the body into language; materialism, in contrast, maintains that there are aspects of life, including embodied life, which are ontologically independent of language" [cite:@capuano2020victorian 1].

Eyes, too, have become a recurring theme in contemporary literary scholarship. Daryl Ogden's 2005 /The Language of the Eyes/ deals with eyes and vision in English literature from 1690-1927, and in particular, powerful glances which hold sexual cononotations. It begins, "to possess empowered eyes has traditionally meant to occupy a male subject position, to engender oneself as masculine," and asks, "how did resistance to the free expression of female eyes, particularly in the culture register of sexuality, become such a powerful and pervasive discourse" [cite:@9780791464991 1–2].

** The Sensory Homunculus

In 1937, neuroscientists Wilder Penfield and Edwin Boldrey electrically stimulated the somatosensory cortices of their subjects' brains, in order to map out the regions responsible for perceiving the various parts of the body [cite:@penfield1937]. They called the resulting map the "sensory homunculus": a topography of the brain's regions responsible for sensing the body. Here is Penfield and Boldrey describing this model:

#+begin_quote
The homunculus gives a visual image of the size and sequence of cortical areas, for the size of the parts of this grotesque creature were determined not so much by the number of responses ... but by the apparent perpendicular extent of representation of each part when these responses were multiple for the same part. / The large size of the thumb and lips indicates that the vertical extent of the Rolandic cortex devoted to those parts in individual cases is very large. Thus the trunk is quite small and the legs and head exceedingly small, while the tongue, which usually occupies a comparatively long strip of the Rolandic lip, is large. [cite:@penfield1937 432]
#+end_quote

[cite:@Fig:homonculus1] illustrates this map, laid over a cross-section of the cortex. This model, it might be said, is how the brain sees the body. In terms of the comparative sizes of neural cortices, the hands, lips, and tongue are very disproportionately important to the brain. In contrast, the limbs and torso are comparatively unimportant.

These proportions are very similar to those which I find in British literature of the 19th and 20th centuries, but with some notable differences. Lips and genitals, for instance, are granted much more attention by the brain than by literature, which suggests a cultural taboo against sexualized writing.

* Conclusions

Through the experiments in this chapter, I discovered a number of facts about the shape of literary history, and have developed several theories which may help to explain them. To summarize, these are:

 1. Objects in general are roughly 12% more common in fiction and poetry of the modern period. Yet this is complicated by the fact that this aggregates living things, which become less common, with artifacts, which become much more common.
 2. This phenomenon is, I argue, due to the heightened visuality in literature of this period.
 3. As with color, proportions of objects are correlated with the genres of juvenile literature. Childhood, and /Bildung/ carry with them modes of perception with heightened aesthetic sensibilities.
 4. Also as with color, large proportions of objects are correlated with travel literature, socio-cultural or anthropological distance.
 5. Body parts are 63% more common in fiction and poetry of the modern period.
 6. Since body parts are use impressionistically, in fiction, as a means of conveying body language or other character traits, this may account for this phenomenon.
 7. The distribution of body objects, or body parts, in fiction largely follows that of the brain's sensory cortex.

**** The Cinema

Begins by conceding, "the art of the cinema seems a simple and even a stupid art." (249) 

"The eye licks it all up instantaneously and the brain, agreeably titillated, settles down to watch things happening without bestirring itself to think. For the ordinary eye, the English unaesthetic eye, is a simple mechanism, which takes care that the body does not fall down coal-holes..." (249-50)

"All the famous novels of thte world with their well known characters and their famous scenes only asked to be put on the films." (250-1) 

"For what characteristics does thought possess which can be rendered visible to the eye without the help of words? It has speed and slowness; dart-like directness and vaporous circumlocution. But it has also an inveterate tendency especially in moments of emotion to make images run side by side with itself, to create a likeness of the thing thought about, as if by so doing it took away its sting, or made it beautiful and comprehensible. In Shakespeare, as everybody knows, the most complex ideas, the most intense emotions form chains of images, through which we pass, however rapidly and completely they change, as up the loops and spirals of a twisting stair." (252-3)

**** "How Should One Read a Book?"
"Thus reading poetry often seems a state of rhapsody in which rhyme and metre and sound stir the mind as wine and dance stir the body, and we read on, understanding with the senses, not with the intellect, in a state of intoxication. Yet all this intoxication and intensity of delight depend upon the exactitude and truth of the image, on its being the counterpart of the reality within. Remote and extravagant as some of Shakespeare's images seem, far-fetched and ethereal as some of Keats's, at the moment of reading they seem the cap and culmination of the thought; its final expression." (131-132)

Shapes: "There they hang in the wardrobe of our mind—the shapes of the books we have read, as we hung them up and put them away when we had done with them." 
- Shapes of books. Not colors? Books are nothing but words.

Ends with a nod to evolution that sounds like Outline of History: "the reason why we have grown from pigs to men and women, and come out from our caves, and dropped our bows and arrows, and sat round the fire and talked and drunk and made merry and given to the poor and helped the sick and made pavements and houses and erected some sort of shelter and society on the waste of the world, is nothing but this: we have loved reading." (134-5)

**** "Poetry, Fiction, and the Future"
"For if we look at the state of the poetic play we must have grave doubts that any force on earth can now revive it. It has been practiced and is still pacticed by writers of the highest genius and ambition." (137-8)
- This is what she does with /The Waves/, which she calls a play-poem.
- Generic boundaries chafe

"For of course poetry has always been overwhelmingly on the side of beauty. She has always insisted on certain rights, such as rhyme, metre, poetic diction. She has never been used for the common purpose of life. Prose has taken all the dirty work on to her own shoulders; has answered letters, paid bills, written articles, served the needs of businessmen, shopkeepers, lawyers, soldiers, peasants." (142-3)
- Gendering of genres

"It may be possible that prose is going to take over—has, indeed, already taken over—some of the duties which were once discharged by poetry." (143-144)

"And it is possible that there will be among the so-called novels one which we shall scarcely know how to christen. It will be written in prose, but in prose which has many of the characteristics of poetry. It will have something of the exaltation of poetry, but much of the ordinariness of prose. It will be dramatic, and yet not a play. It will be read, not acted." (143-144)

"But one has always a feeling of discomfort in the presence of the purple patch or the prose poem. The objection to the purple patch, however, is not that it is purple but that it is a patch." (146-7)

"So, then, this unnamed variety of the novel will be written standing back from life, because in that way a larger view is to be obtained of some important features of it; it will be written in prose, because prose, if you free it from the beast-of-burden work which so many novelists necessarily lay upon it, of carrying loads of details, bushels of fact—prose thus treated will show itself capable of rising high from the ground, not in one dart, but in sweeps and circles, and of keeping at the same time in touch with the amusements and idiosyncrasies of human character in daily life." (147-8)

**** Modern Fiction
Deals with writers who are "spiritual" and "material"

"It can scarcely be said of Mr Wells that he is a materialist in the sense that he takes too much delight in the solidity of his fabric. ... He is a materialist from sheer goodness of heart, taking upon his shoulders the work that ought to have been discharged by Government officials" (52-3)

* WAITING 1923 - Monroe & Henderson - The New Poetry: An Anthology of Twentieth-century Verse in English
[[#monroe1923new][monroe1923new]]

Edited, Harriet Monroe

* DONE 2018 - Schotter - Hieroglyphic Modernisms: Writing and New Media in the Twentieth Century
[[#schotter2018hieroglyphic][schotter2018hieroglyphic]]

Opens by citing American poet and film critic Vachel Lindsay, who says "American civilization grows more hieroglyphic every day" (1)

"Novelists and theorists in the early twentieth century took for granted what N. Katherine Hayles would call comparative media studies: treating text as a medium in dialogue with other competing media." (2)

"The process of media interrelation that Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin call 'remediation'—the 'representation of one medium in another'—becomes the constitutive ontological basis of all media in the twentieth century, not simply a tactic within particular media texts." (3)

Notes "Egyptian vogue" of 1920s
- Egyptian Theater in Hollywood
- Howard Carter discovers King Tut's tomb, 1922

"Hieroglyphs were not a pure or mystical language of images, but rather an alphabet akin to any other." (5)
- Like Chinese

Says Kenner highlights the "fascination with visual languages" & Chinese idiograms 
- traces this thread "From Kenner up through Marjorie Perloff and Johanna Drucker to contemporary studies like Christopher Bush's /Idiographic Modernism/ and Eric Hayot's /Chinese Dreams/" (6)

Foucalt on hieroglyphs in /The Order of Things/

Notes that hieroglyphics need decipherment, which needs a commentary layer
- Eliot's footnotes to "The Waste Land"

Rorty ([[#rorty1992linguistic][rorty1992linguistic]] 3) "has famously argues that the twentieth century witnessed a 'linguistic turn,' defined in philosophy by the belief 'that philosophical problems are problems which may be solved (or dissolved) either by reforming language, or by understanding more about the language we presently use.'" 
- "In response, W.J.T. Mitchell argues for a 'pictorial turn': a growing interest over the course of the twentieth century in images and in the 'material traces' of writing itself.' (8)

Cites Wittgenstein, /Tractatus/, which deals with hieroglyphs

Says that Derrida "falls victim to a mystical view of writing, privileging writing above speech so fervently..."  (10)
- "As Rey Chow writes, 'The East is preserved in an essentialist, unchanging condition in Derrida's text.'" (10)
  - see [[#chow2002protestant][chow2002protestant]]

"If Woolf seeks to collapse the gap between perception, character and language, then Joseph Conrad and Orson Welles call attention to the way in which innovative narrative structures can expose the hybrid nature of all media forms." (15) 

"The history of hieroglyphics in the West is the history of a misconception. From the very beginning up to, in many cases, the present day, most Western interpreters believed that Egyptian hieroglyphs were something they never were: a language of symbolic or motivated signs." (25)

"Hieroglyphics became not only a more visual or motivated language, but potentially the original language of all humanity." (28) 

"Hieroglyphics thus often became associated with gestures—another less mediated form of communication—blurring the line between writing and the human body. In many theories of linguistic evolution drawn upon by the modernists, language evolves from gestures to hieroglyphics to alphabets. Hieroglyphics thus become not merely a more perfect language. By collapsing the sign and the signifier, they also promised the God-like power of deciphering the hidden language of the world or the body itself." (29) 

"Leibniz, John Wilkins and Sir Francis Bacon derived their notions of logical languages, at least in part, from Chinese ideograms, and these ideograms themselves they believed were partly based on Egyptian hieroglyphs." (30)

"Hieroglyphics, it turned out, were not a more visual alternative to Western languages but rather were fundamentally hybrid, predominately phonetic and only marginally more pictorial than Western alphabets." (31) 

And symbolist influence 32 

Argues that modernism misreads Egypt, China to create an ideal. 

"Particularly in the mid-1920s,—when she was writing /To the Lighthouse/ and /Mrs Dalloway/, as well as 'The Cinema' and her story 'The Lady in the Looking-Glass'—Woolf, spurred by her encounter with film, increasingly emphasises the hybrid qualities of written words, between image and sound." (62) 

Also touches on Joyce and Esperanto in later chapters. A lot about film here.

[[#gleason2009][gleason2009]]

Cites "the imageless thought debate that swirled in the wake of Wilhelm Wundt's 1879 imagery experiments at Leipzig" (424)

** WAITING 2001 - Imagist Poetry
[[#jones2001imagist][jones2001imagist]]

https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-z22_hquOvsC&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PT135.w.5.0.27

Eliot opines about the importance of Imagism:
- "The /point de repere usually and conveniently taken as the starting-point of modern poetry is the group denominated 'imagists' in London about 1910." (16)
  - From 'American Lit. and the American Language,' 1953

Against sentimentality, FMF in 1913: "the song of birds, moonlight—these the poet playing for safety and the critic trying to find something to praise, will deem the sure cards of the poetic pack. They seem the safe things to sentimentalize over and it is taken for granted that sentimentality is the business of poetry." (16)

First imagist poems: Jones: "the poems 'Autumn' and 'A City Sunset' by Hulme, which the Poets' Club printed in January 1909 in a booklet called /For Christmas MDCCCCVII/ may reasonably be termed the first 'imagist' poems, although the word itself was not yet in use." (16) 

Flint on symbolist influence: "There was also a lot of talk and practice among us, Storer leading it chiefly, of what we called the Image. We were very much influenced by Modern French Symbolist poetry." (18)

- Letter EP -> Harriet Monroe (141), begins "Poetry must be /as well written as prose./"

"Language is made out of concrete things." (138)

F.S. Flint enjoins J.C. Squire to "read Mr Bourdillon on the Imagistes in the Times of two weeks back; there you have England"
- meaning the England that rejects imagism
- can't seem to find this; letter dated 29th Jan 1917

"We wish to be considered as poets, first of all, and our writings to be judged by the poetic emotion and *vision* in them." [emphasis mine] (141)

143 sonnet competition between HD and FS Flint, results in [[https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-z22_hquOvsC&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PT142]["To a Young Lady / Who Moved Shyly Among Men / of Reputed Worth"]];

** TODO 1972 - Imagism \& the Imagists: A Study in Modern Poetry
[[#hughes1972imagism][hughes1972imagism]]

Should contain ideas about the influence of imagism? 

I actually don't think it's 1972, but much earlier? 

Traces the genealogy of imagism to: 
- reaction against immediately preceding poetry
- influence of East Asian poetry (esp. Pound)
- influence of French symbolist poetry
  - and Parnassians before them

"At the outset we find ourselves concerned with the activities of a relatively unknown man, T.E. Hulme, an aesthetic philosopher who quite reasonably might be called the 'father of Imagism.'" (9)

** WAITING ABC of Reading
[[#pound_abc_1960][pound_abc_1960]]

Ch. 8 begins: "Language is a means of communication," says the "three chief means" of "charg[ing] language to the utmost possible degree" include: 
- "throwing the object (fixed or moving) onto the visual imagination"

"The Egyptians finally used abbreviated pictures to represent sounds, but the Chinese still use abbreviated pictures AS pictures, that is to say, the Chinese idiogram does not try to be the picture of a sound, or to be a written sign recalling a sound, but it is still the picture of a thing; of a thing in a given position or relation, or of a combination of thingsr. It /means/ the thing or the action or situation, or quality germane to the several things that it pictures."

At Butler: [[https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/10492171?counter][The art of the text : visuality in nineteenth- and twentieth-century literary and other media - CLIO]]

Looks mostly like it's about French theorists.

Seems to understand "visuality" as "visual culture," i.e. intermedia. Doesn't really tackle the reader's visual imagination.

[[#pound1913][pound1913]]

Directly follows [[#flint1913][flint1913]]. 

Actually comes out against description. "Don't be descriptive; remember that the painter can describe a landscape much better than you can, and that he has to know a deal more about it. When Shakespeare talks of the 'Dawn in russet mantle clad' he presents something which the painter does not present. There is in this line of his nothing that one can call description; he presents." (203)

"Consider the way of the scientists rather than the way of an advertising agent for a new soap." (203)
- Would Joyce disagree?

Lots of attention to the "music" of poetry: rhyme, music, etc. 

Concreteness, predecessors: 
- "Consider the definiteness of Dante's presentation, as compared with Milton's rhetoric. Read as much of Wordsworth as does not seem too unutterably dull.

*** WAITING 2009 - Fenollosa, Pound, Saussy \& Klein - The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry: A Critical Edition
[[#fenollosa2009chinese][fenollosa2009chinese]]

"written circa 1903, discovered 1915, published 1919" (8)

pointedly willful ignorance of the Chinese language

Pound on Victorians: “For Milton and Victorianism and the softness of the ‘nineties’ I have different degrees of antipathy and even contempt. . . . The ‘nineties’ have chiefly gone out because of their muzziness, because of a softness derived, I think, not from books but from impressionist painting. They riot with half decayed fruit.” (17)
- Pound, “Lionel Johnson,” Literary Essays , 362– 63.

**** Influence
"The place of Ernest Francisco Fenollosa’s essay “The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry” as a major document of twentieth-century American poetry and poetics is secure— if only that is the right place to put it. Donald Davie considered it “perhaps the only English document of our time fit to rank with Sidney’s Apologie, and the Preface to Lyrical Ballads, and Shelley’s Defence.” And Charles Olson: “the damned best piece on language since when.”" (1)

**** Critique
"The Yale linguist George A. Kennedy called it “a mass of confusion” based on a “complete misunderstanding” of the Chinese language." (2)

From introrduction: "So, quixotically in the eyes of anyone who knows the history of Chinese linguistics and archaeology, Pound attempted, in an unpublished essay in Italian, to rebut Bernhard Karlgren’s reconstruction of phonetic word-families in ancient Chinese. 28 Karlgren had shown (in his Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese [1923] and Grammata Serica Recensa [1940]) that the overwhelming majority of Chinese characters, even many that had long been taken to be compound pictograms, were formed from a semantic clue added to a phonetic clue, and that the phonetic clues taken together gave a clear if not always definite map of the pronunciation of archaic Chinese." (8) 


**** On Cathay
"Another group of reworked translations (thirteen poems), Cathay: For the Most Part from the Chinese of Rihaku, from the Notes of the Late Ernest Fenollosa, and the Decipherings of the Professors Mori and Ariga, appeared in 1915, and competes with Eliot’s The Waste Land (1922) and Stevens’s Harmonium (1923) for the title of the most influential English-language poetic collection of the century."

Charts the importance of Hudson Maxim (chemist): 
- Pound reviews Maxim's /Science of Poetry/ in 1910 (52)
- this review is in [[#pound91][pound91]], 40

"For Maxim, poetry consists of 'elemental constants' that can be revealed by the logical analysis of certain 'incontrovertible facts' governing language development, principally, the 'fact' that metaphor is 'the master instrument of human speech' ... the best poetry is that which efficiently communicates 'the unfamiliar, the abstract' through the 'familiar, the concrete': 'poetry is largely an act of visualization'." 

**** Pound and Gourmont:

Pound reads Remy de Gourmont's /Le Problème du style/ in 1912
- discussed in [[#sherry1993ezra][sherry1993ezra]]
- "Just over a year after reading Maxim's /The Science of Poetry/, Pound first encountered Remy de Gourmont's /Le Problème du style/, which Richard Sieburth and Vincent Sherry have shown was decisive in moving Pound towards a system of values predicated on the primacy of vision. For Gourmont, as for Maxim, abstract ideas must be transformed into visual images do be effectively communicated." (53-4)

**** Pound on Non-Visuality

"Certain people think with words, certain with, or in, objects, others realize nothing until they have pictured it; other progress by diagrams like those of the geometricians; some think, or construct in rhythm, or by rhythm in sound; others, the unfortunate, move by words disconnected from the objects to which they might correspond, or more unfortunate still in blocks and /clichés/ of words; some, favoured of Apollo, in words that hover above and cling close to the things they mean..." (54)

From summary: 

#+begin_quote
A la fin des années 1920, l’écrivaine américaine moderniste H.D. considère le cinéma comme un art majeur, supérieur à la littérature car plus à même de représenter le réel. En réponse à un questionnaire lui demandant de faire le bilan de sa carrière, elle choisit de se concentrer sur sa découverte du septième art et sur l’importance que prend ce nouveau mode d’expression pour elle. Spectatrice, mais aussi actrice, monteuse et critique, H.D. adopte une approche polyvalente. Des réalisateurs comme G. W. Pabst ou Sergueï Eisenstein deviennent des modèles que les écrivains devraient imiter, selon l’auteur. Pendant environ cinq ans, H.D. s’implique directement dans la production cinématographique, de par son travail avec un jeune artiste britannique, Kenneth Macpherson, réalisateur de Borderline, long-métrage d’avant-garde dont elle tient le rôle féminin principal. H.D. rédige également plusieurs critiques de films, qui paraissent dans Close Up, un magazine qu’elle co- dirige avec l’auteur et mécène britannique Bryher ainsi que Macpherson. Par la suite, ses activités cinématographiques diminuent mais nous avançons l’idée que le septième art et les théories qu’elle en retient influencent de façon durable son imaginaire et son mode d’écriture.

[[#connor2004h][connor2004h]]

Concentrates heavily on cinema and transmedia. 

"In modernist fiction, it can be seen in the rejection of the realist mode, which attempted to represent experience 'authentically', an in the focus on the interiority of the individual psyche. This fascination for the inner workings of consciousness—prompted in part by the growing interest in Freudian psychology at the turn of the nineteenth century—is as evident in the texts of lesser known women writers like Dorothy Richardson, Katherine Mansfield and Jean Rhys as it is in the work of canonical 'giants' like James Joyce, T.S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf." (3)

Whimsical look at the Haiku form. Ends by proposing a contest, with a first prize of ten dollars, on this theme: "A young lover, distracted by jealousy, finds himself looking out over New York harbor. The sun is setting. The gigantic buildings and towers of Manhattan are silhouetted against the summer sky." 

"3. The Hokku should not be alliteration, suggestion, allusion, or epigram, though it is, in part, all of these. The Hokku is, in a word—a MOOD. 4. The Hokku is a cunningly cut jewel of words. It is like a diamond or an alexandrite, clear or colored, but reflecting varied rays of thought as the light of the mind plays over it." (46) 

*** WAITING 2018 - Pound, Billings, Bush \& Saussy - Cathay: A Critical Edition
[[#pound2018cathay][pound2018cathay]]

https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-L-IDwAAQBAJ&hl=en&pg=GBS.PR17

From Haun Saussy's foreword: 
- When one compares Pound's "translation" to W.A.P. Martin's sing-songy version, "one surmises disgust as the motive of modernist poetics: the editorial red pencil hacking away at limp and pretentious decoration. ... /Cathay/ embodied a comprehensive refusal of the Edwardian verse just then being stirred into action by the Great War." (xv)

See [[On Cathay]] in [[#fenollosa2009chinese][fenollosa2009chinese]] Fenollosa

Really seems to imply a continuity between Tang dynasty poetry and modern poetry, ancient Chinese language (not really understandable by modern Chinese people) and modern. 

**** Christopher Bush's introduction
calls /Cathay/ "a collection of Chinese poems translated, for lack of a better word, by someone who did not know Chinese and who was relying almost exclusively on the decades-old handwritten notes of someone who was himself only just learning to read Chinese from some Japanese tutors." (1)

"Pound offered a vision of Chinese as disarmingly direct, even simple, something close to a universal language of common nouns and common feelings. Despite his well-known love, and production, of difficult reading, with /Cathay/ Pound seemed to make good on the Wordsworthian project of bringing the language of poetry closer to the language of men." (2)

"... one need not know where 'Cho-fu-Sa' is or who 'General Rishogu' was to understand or appreciate the poems. (Pound himself often had little idea.)" (2) 
- These are signs of exoticism.
- They do not signify the places themselves, but the /exotic, distant place/

Quotes Eliot: "if one can really penetrate the life of another age, one is penetrating one's own ... [Pound is] much more modern, in my opinion, when he deals with Italy and Provence, than when he deals with modern life ... When he deals with antiquities, he extracts the essentially living." (3) 

Cites as a major influence /Le livre de jade/ (Judith Gautier) (5)
- Also Mori Kainan (1863-1911) (7),
- Ariga Nagao (1860-1921) (8)

/kundoku/: Sino-Japanese hybrid "interlanguage," neither really Chinese nor Japanese. 

"there are historically and linguistically specific reasons why /Cathay/ might not best be eavluated as an English-language translation of a Chinese-language text, but rather as a reading of the 'decipherings' of Mori and Ariga which, along with Fenollosa's notes, were the basis of /Cathay/." (10)

*** WAITING 1914 - Noguchi - The Spirit of Japanese Poetry
[[#noguchi1914spirit][noguchi1914spirit]]

Begins, "I come always to the conclusion that the English poets waste too much energy in 'words, words, words,' and make, doubtless with all good intentions, their inner meaning frustrate, at least less distinguished, simgly from the reason that its full liberty to appear naked is denied." 

"Explanation is forbidden in the House of Poesy for Japanese, where, as in the Japanese tea-house of four mats and a half, the Abode of Imagination, only the hints tender and gray, like a ghost or Miss Resse's rain, are suffered to be dwelling." (21) 

Chapter "The Japanese Hokku Poetry" discusses Pater's take on lyrical poetry as approaching music, the highest claim of art

"I should like to develop Pater's literary ideal a little further through Lao Tze's canon of spiritual anarchism" (33) 

"When I say that the /Hokku/ poet's chief aim is to impress the readers with the high atmosphere in which he is living, I mean that the readers also should be those living in an equally high poetical atmosphere; such readers' minds will certainly respond to the wistfulness and delicacy of the /Hokku/, a wistfulness and delicacy not to be met with in the general run of English poetry." (36) 
- This is very much the exile's stance

Pantheism: "You may think it pantheism if you will, when our Japanese poets go to Nature to make life more meaningful, sing of flowers and birds to make humanity more intensive; it was from the sense of mystical affinity between the life of Nature and the life of man..." (37)

"Consider this again in the case of memory. Bergson has emphasized the fact that the progress of human consciousness has been toward homogeneous space, for the greater possibilities of action. He has not in his discussion of memory specifically stated what seems to me obvious, if the first conclusion be true: the acquisition of his second kind of memory, the continuous type, is only another triumph in spatialisation. He concedes, you remember, that the whole of past experience may be latent in the animals. The differentia is the power of visualisation of this experience, and what is visualisation but spatialisation? The future is ideal construction, and is spatial also."

Avery Fine Arts (Non-Circulating) N6764 F64

"The Victorians were fascinated with the act of seeing, with the question of the reliability-or otherwise-of the human eye, and with the problems of interpreting what they saw." (1)
- This is a testable claim, I think.

Cites Jean-Louis Comolli: "The second half of the nineteenth century lives in a sort of frenzy of the visible"

Foucault: /Discipline and Punish/ "famously drew attention to the power of the gaze within Victorian social formations." (6)

"Victorian ways of seeing, in broad terms, were both modelled upon, and effectively legitimated by, certain dominant strands within contemporary science, especially the work of physiologists, and of natural scientists, whose work with the microscope in particular provided an endless source of comments filtering into popular culture about how the invisible could be brought into view, and how knowledge and control over the natural world could thus be obtained." (8)

Fascinating stuff here. Probably won't use this, though. 

** DONE 1970 - The English novel from Dickens to Lawrence
[[#williams1970english][williams1970english]]

Williams apparent charts a kind of genealogy of the English novel, going chronologically. However, there's an interesting chapter sandwiched between Hardy and Conrad: "A Parting of the Ways," which suggests that a single line can no longer connect all of these writers, from that point forward. 
- It's Wells in /Tono Bungay/ that is responsible for this split:

Williams notices "a new note: a new consciousness, self-consciousness of the 'modern':"

And quotes Wells: 

#+begin_quote
England Was all Bladesover two hundred years ago; ... it has had reform Acts indeed, and such-like changes of formula, but no essential revolution since then; ... all that is modern and different has come in as a thing intruded or as a gloss upon this predominant formula, either impertinently or apologetically." (125-6)
#+end_quote

Of this, W comments: "it is here, really, that the split takes place. To accept that world, that form, was in a very deep way to accept its consciousness. ... To question [it] ... was a break in texture where consciousness itself was determined; an assault, or so it seemed, not only on the form of the novel but on an idea, /the/ idea, of literature itself." (126)

James describes being very influenced by Bergson. 

Traces history of "intellectualist" philosophy from Plato to Kant and Nietzsche

Describes the difficulty of handling perception in philosophy. 
- "Ordinary perception is in a great part intellectualised. We break the flux of sensible reality into 'things.' Here arises the difficulty any intellectualist system has in finding a unity. But there is an absolute perception, uninfluenced by the superimposed 'cadres' of intellect and memory. This is the 'immédiament donnée.' This is the only absolute with which philosophy can legitimately deal." (198)
- And reality: "Thought only deals with surfaces, it cannot imitate the 'thickness' of experience. Reality has a fulness of content that no conceptual description can equal." (198)
  - via negativa here again
- "It is obvious that this is the exact antithesis of the Platonic metaphysics, where the changing flux is dismissed as appearance and reality is found in the stable concepts of the intellect." (199)

[[#hulme98_selec][hulme98_selec]]


*** McGuiness Introduction
Calls H a "mixer and matcher" of "socialist, anarchist, and reactionary political philosophies" (viii)

H ultra-conservative, very Tory, especially later

Bergson writes a glowing letter of recommendation for him in 1912, as he attempts to re-enroll in Cambridge (xv)

Killed in the trenches, Flanders 1917 (xix)

"Analogy itself is a means of understanding one thing through the workings of another, and analogy is crucial to Hulme. His /analogical imagination/, a direct response to lack of 'unity', consists in something like this procedure: there is no unity, and permanent comprehension is impossible; it thus becomes necessary not to look for absolutes, but to thread items of knowledge together by means of correspondences, analogically." (xxi)

H on Poetry/prose: "verse is pedestrian, taking you over the ground, prose—a train delivers you at a destination." (xxiv)

V. Shklovsky, 1914: "the most ancient poetic creation of man was the creation of words. Now words are dead, and language is like a graveyard, but an image was once alive in the newly-born word." (xxv)

H: 'A great revolution in music when for the melody that is one-dimensional music was substituted harmony which moves in two. Two visual images unite to form what one may call a visual chord. They unite to suggest an image which is different to both." (xxx)
- Bergson's /images successives/

Of H: "'Romanticism' is also a repository of things he dislikes, and which were in dire disrepute among the Anglo-American modernists generally: VIctoriana, Pre-Raphaelitism, dilettante criticism and general self-indulgence ('emotions [...] grouped round the word infinite')." (xxxvi)

Eliot calls H "the forerunner of a new attitude of mind, which should be the twentieth-century mind" and opposes him with Russell. Calls H "a really great poet" in 1919 (xliii n1) 

*** Notes on Language and Style
"Probably written around 1907" (224) but first published 1925

"...in algebra, the real things are replaced by symbols. These symbols are manipulated according to certain laws which are independent of their meaning. ... An analogous phenomenon happens in reasoning in language. We replace meaning (i.e. /vision/) by words. These words fall into well-known patterns, i.e. into certain well-known phrases which we accept without thinking of their meaning, just as we do the /x/ in algebra." (37)

"All emotion depends on real solid vision or sound. It is physical. But in /rhetoric/ and expositional prose we get words divorced from any real vision. Rhetoric and emotion—here the connection is different. So perhaps literary expression is from /Real/ to /Real/ with all the intermediate forms keeping their /real/ value." (38)
- Mapping, theory of communication

"Each /word/ much be an image /seen/" (38)

Romantic poetry as at a remove from that (prose) he has in mind: "The contrast between (i) a firm simple prose, creating in a definite way a fairy story, a story of simple life in the country ... Here we have the microcosm of poetry. The pieces piked out from which it comes. Sun and sweat and all of them. Physical life and death fairies. And (ii) on the other hand, genteel poetry like Shelley's, which refers in elaborate analogies to the things mentioned in (i)." (39)

Uses "firm" and "solid" throughout here - bodies.
- "Rising disgust and impatience with the talking books, e.g. Lilly and the books about Life, Science, and Religion. All the books which seem to be the kind of talk one could do if one wished. / Rather choose those in old leather, which are /solid/. Here the man did not talk, but saw solid, definite things and described them. Solidity a pleasure." (39)
- "The resistance of the ὕλη ἐνέργες. The process of invention is that of gradually making solid the castles in the air." (40)
  - The term is Aristotle, Hyle Energies, matter and energy.

Poetry/Prose a major concern: 

#+begin_quote
(i) New phrases made in poetry, tested, and then employed in prose. 
(ii) In poetry they are all glitter and new coruscation, in prose useful and not noticed.
(iii) Prose a museum where all the old weapons of poetry kept.
(iv) Poetry always the advance guard in language. The progress of language is the absorption of new analogies. (41)
#+end_quote

"/Language/. Large clumsy instrument. Language does not naturally come with meaning. Ten different ways of forming the same sentence. Any style will do to get the meaning down (without childish effefct). There is /no/ inevitable simple style as there ought to be. / Language a cumbrous growth, a compound of old and new analogies. Does this apply to thought? Is there /no/ simple thought, but only styles of thought? / Poetry is neither more nor less than a mosaic of words, so great exactness required for each one." (43)
- Recalls what Pound says about imagism.

Writing as thinking: 
- "It was formerly my idea that a poem was made somewhat as follows: The poet, in common with many other people, occasionally experienced emotions which strangely moved him. ... The poet ... tried to find new imagess to express what he felt. These lines and vague collections of words he gradually built up into poemt. Ut this I now see to be wrong; the very act of trying to find a form to fit the separate phrases into, itself leads to the creation of new images hitherto not felt by the poet. In a sense the poetry writes itself. ... /Creative/ effort means /new/ images." (54)

Influence of Whitman: 
- "Whitman had a theory that every object under the sun comes within the range of poetry. But he was too early in the day." (56)
- But later: "Whitman went wrong through deficiency of selective process." (57)

"Poetasters write in metre because poets have done so, poets because singing, not talking, is the obvious mode of expressing ecstasy." (56) 

Against Yeats: "W.B. Yeats attempts to ennoble his craft by strenuously believing in supernatural world, race-memory, magic, and saying that symbols can recall these where prose couldn't. This is an attempt to bring in an infinity again." (57) 

On realism: "If literature (realistic) did really resemble life, it would be interminable dreary, commonplace, eating and dressing, buttoning, with here and there a patch of vividness. Zola merely selects an interesting group of sordid pieces." (58)

*** A Lecture on Modern Poetry
- "Probably given to the Poet's Club in 1908." (224n1)

"A reviewer writing in the /Saturday Review/ last week spoke of poetry as the means by which the soul soared into highter regions, and as a means of expression by which it became merged into a higher kind of reality. Well, that is the kind of statement that I utterly detest. I want to speak of verse in a plain way as I would of pigs: that is the only honest way." (59) 

Rebellion: "I have not a catholic taste but a violently personal and prejudiced one. I have no reverence for tradition. I came to the subject of verse from the inside rather than from the outside. There were certain impressions which I wanted to fix. I read verse to find models but I could not find any that seemed exactly suitable to express that kind of impression, except perhaps a few jerky rhythm of Henley, until I came to read the French /vers-libre/, which sseemed to exactly fit the case." (60)

"Personally I am of course in favour of the complete destruction of all verse more than twenty years old." (60)

On symbolists: *a band of poets perhaps unequalled at any one time in the history of French poetry*." (62) 
- Desc. of techne: "The new technique was first definitely stated by Kahn. It consisted in a denial of a regular number of syllables as the basis of versification. The length of the line is long and short, oscillating with the images used by the poet; it follows the contours of his thoughts and is free rather than regular; to use a rough analogy, it is clothes made to order, rather than ready-made clothes." (62)

Aligned with impressionism: "We still perceive the mystery of things, but we perceive it in entirely a different way—no longer directly in the form of action, but as an impression, for example Whistler's pictures. We can't escape from the spirit of our times. What has found expression in paining as Impressionism will soon find expression in poetry in free verse." (63-64)
- Note says these are probably the Nocturnes

"A great revolution in music when for the melody that is one-dimensional music, was substituted harmony which moves in two. Two visual images form what one may call a visual chord. They unite to suggest an image which is different to both." (64) 

Ends: "One might sum it all up in this way: a shell is a very suitable covering for the egg at a certain period of its career, but very unsuitable at a later age. This seems to me to represent fairly well the state of verse at the present time. While the shell remains the same, the inside character is entirely changed. It is not addled as a pessimist might say, but has become alive, it has changes from the ancient art of chanting to the modern impressionist, but the mechanism of verse has remained the same. I tcan't go on doing so. I will conclude, ladies and gentlemen, by saying, the shell must be broken." (66-67) 

*** Romanticism and Classicism
"Probably a lecture, around 1911 or 1912." (224n1) 

"I want to maintain that after a hundred years of romanticism, we are in for a classical revival, and that the particular weapon of this new classical spirit, when it work in verse, will be fancy. ... I shall have to prove then two things, first that a classical revival is coming, and, secondly, for its particular purposes, fancy will be superior to imagination." (68) 
- Fancy/Imagination dichotomy?

"Just as in the case of the other instincts, Nature has her revenge. The instincts that find their right and proper outlet in religion must come out in some other way. You don't believe in a God, so you begin to believe that man is a god. You don't believe in Heaven, so you begin to believe in a heaven on earth. In other words, you get romanticism. The concepts that are right and proper in their own shpere are spread over, and so mess up, falsify and blur the clear outlines of human experience. It is like pouring a pot of treacle over the dinner table. Romaticism then, and this is the best definition I can give of it, is spilt religion." (71)

Identifies habits of "the romantic": "because he thinks man infinite, must always be talking about the infinite; and as there is always the bitter contrast between what you think you ought to be able to do and what man actually can, it always tends, in its later stages at any rate, to be gloomy." (71)
- "You might say if you wished that the whole of the romantic attitude seems to crystallise in verse round metaphors of flight. Hugo is always flying, flying over abysses, flying up into the eternal gases. The word infinit in every other line." (72)
- "In the classical attitude you never seem to swing right along to the infinite nothing."  (72)

Q.v. Nietzsche's Dionysian/Appolonian dichotomy. 
- His later "crucified"/"Dionysus" pen-names

"How many people now can lay their hands on their hearts and say they like either Horace or Pope? They feel a kind of chill when they read them. The dry hardness which you get in the classics is absolutely repugnant to theme. Poetry that isn't damp isn't poetry at all. *They cannot see that accurate description is a legitimate object of verse.* Verse to them alwyas means a bringing in of some of the emotions that are grouped round the word infinite." (75) 
- Q.v. Pound's "hardness" or "Hellenic hardness"

He is against Ruskin and his ideas of "imagination" 

Gaze: "If you are walking behind a woman in the street, you notice the curious way in which the skirt rebounds from her heels. If that peculiar kind of motion becomes of such interest to you that you will search about until you can get the exact epithet which hits it off, there you have a properly aesthetic emotion. But is is the zest with which you look at the thing which decides you to make the effort." (81) 

On fancy: "Fancy is not mere decoration added on to plain speech. Plain speech is essentially inaccurate. It is only by new metaphors, that is, by fancy, that it can be made precise." (81)
- Again with "precision." (See H.D.'s(?) watchword)
- This "fancy" is akin to "zest," or "desire."
- Has overtones of imagination, yet Hulme rejects Ruskin's imagination (earlier)
- The overtones of fancy as sexual attraction (do you fancy me?) in British slang are noticeable

** WAITING 2016 - Gasiorek & Comentale - T.E. Hulme and the Question of Modernism
[[#gasiorek2016t][gasiorek2016t]]

Intro: "his writing wittily conflates reason and appetite, foregrounding the tensions between language and the body. His work, in fact, may be one of the first to theorize modernism as a unique social formation founded upon the constant production and consumption of discourse." (2) 

"...his real significance begins to emerge when we focus on him as one of the most important conduits for modern thought in the pre-1914 phase of a basely emergent British modernism, during which he functioned as a one man Vortex" (2) 

"much of what Hulme admired in Bergson's thought was already present in his own: the empiness of rational thought, the impossibility of pure vision, the intensive structures of the material world; both thinkers condemned the ideological closure of a rational world and sought release in a more dynamic interplay of self and other." (3) 

Hulme defines himself against what has come before: "his critique of modernity focuses on the reification of romantic ideology and traces its corrupt effects in all areas of thought: liberalism in politics, relativism in philosophy, positivism in science, dynamism in the arts." (3-4) 

*Oscillation between romantic and classical periods*: "Hulme's attempt to theorize a historical dialectic and thus the emergence of the modern period exposed similar discontinuities. While a residual Hegelianism in his thought led him to posit an oscillation of romantic and classical periods, the materialist in his knew that history was an untidy affair, fractured in its development and diverse in its effects." (5)

H: "For an objective view of reality we must make use both of the categories of continuity and discontinuity." (CW 423, quoted on 5)  

"His work offers one of the most sustained theoretical accounts of modernist discourse." (7) 

Hulme as public-sphere intellectual (7) 

"The body—its appetites and desires—intrudes constantly in his prose, inflating, distorting, and contradicting its self-proclaimed sensibility." (9)

Importance: "...it was Hulme's writing and thinking about poetic language that had the greatest impact upon his contemporaries. Here, his work is founded upon the conviction that a tranformative potential could inhere in a particular conception of modern art. His theory of the image became a cornerstone of modernist poetics as well as modernist politics in that it emphasized an anti-romanic return to objective language and thus functioned, particularly in the hands of Eliot and Pound, as a critique of a corrupt bourgeois tradition and the abstractions of the market place." 

*"Hulme, for example, insists that the poet 'turn all his words into visions, in realities we can see"* (11)

*"Indeed, for Hulme, the visual image is only the starting point for an even more concrete theory of language."* (11-12) 

"Hulme advances a theory of representation that radically undermines the romantic distinction between experience and expression, between world and word. He hints at a more dynamic language and thus a more supple epistemology, one that is both perceptive and creative, conscious and vital." (12) 

"Modernism is now conceived less in terms of particular movements or individual figures and more in terms of its characteristic tendency to cross boundaries, disturb classifications, and weave together multiple discourses. Critics who have concentrated on this interpenetration of trajectories have tended to invoke a plurality of modernisms." (15)

Quotes almost entirely from imagist manifestos

Begins, "Poetry should be burned to the bone by austere fires and washed white with rains of affliction : the poet should love nakedness and the thought of the skeleton under the flesh. But because the public will not pay for poetry it has become the occupation of learned persons, given to soft living among veiled things and unaccustomed to being sacked for talking too much. THis is why from the beautiful stark brode of Blake it has become the idle hussy hung with ornament kept by Lord Tennyson, handed on to Stephen Phillips and now supported at Devonshire Street by the Georgian school. But there has arisen a little band who desire the poet to be as disciplined and efficient at his job as the stevedore. Just as Taylor and Gilbreth want to introduce scientific management into industry so the /imagistes/ want to discover the most puissant way of whirling the scattered star dust of words into a new star of passion." (86) 
- Suggests that "imagisme" runs counter to Georgians, aligned with Blake, not aligned with Tennyson.
- aligns them with science

*"Écrire bien, avoir du style, et selon M. Albalat, user d'un style « descriptif ou de couleur », c'est peindre. La faculté maîtresse du style, c'est donc la mémoire visuelle. Si l'écrivain ne voit pas ce qu'il décrit, ce qu'il raconte, paysages et figures, mouvements et gestes, comment aurait-il du style, c'est-à-dire, en somme, de l'originalité? Le peintre qui travaille « de chic » a devant les yeux la scène imaginaire qu'il traduit à mesure. De fort belles oeuvres ont été faites ainsi. Qui dit peintre, dit visuel. M. Jules Claretie a noté, à propos de Ziom, que presque tous les peintres « écrivent bien »; c'est inévitable : ils racontent ce qu'ils voient et cherchent un à un les mots qui traduissent leur vision, comme ils feraient des couleurs, ayant à peindre. Si, à la mémoire visuelle, l'écrivain joint la mémoire émotive, s'il a le pouvoir, en évoquant un spectacle matériel, de se replacer exactement dans l'état émotionnel qui suscita en lui ce spectacle, il possède, même ignorant, tout l'art d'écrire."*

not help exclaiming, "Oh, how beautiful\!" For the great plateful of <span style="color: #0343df" class="color">
blue </span> water was before her; the hoary Lighthouse, distant, austere, in
the midst; and on the right, as far as the eye could see, fading and
falling, in soft low pleats, the <span style="color: #15b01a" class="color"> green </span> sand dunes with the wild flowing
grasses on them, which always seemed to be running away into some moon
country, uninhabited of men.

That was the view, she said, stopping, growing greyer-eyed, that her
husband loved.

She paused a moment. But now, she said, artists had come here. There
indeed, only a few paces off, stood one of them, in Panama hat and <span style="color: #ffff14" class="color">
yellow </span> boots, seriously, softly, absorbedly, for all that he was watched
by ten little boys, with an air of profound contentment on his round <span style="color: #e50000" class="color"> red
</span> face gazing, and then, when he had gazed, dipping; imbuing the tip of
his brush in some soft mound of <span style="color: #15b01a" class="color"> green </span> or <span style="color: #ff81c0" class="color"> pink.</span>  Since Mr. Paunceforte had
been there, three years before, all the pictures were like that, she
said, <span style="color: #15b01a" class="color"> green </span> and <span style="color: #929591" class="color"> grey,</span>  with <span style="color: #fdff52" class="color"> lemon-</span> coloured sailing-boats, and <span style="color: #ff81c0" class="color"> pink </span> women
on the beach.

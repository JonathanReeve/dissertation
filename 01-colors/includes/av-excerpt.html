nearly <span style="color: #ffffff" class="color"> white,</span>  and his skin had become a skin of <span style="color: #e50000" class="color"> red </span> copper shot with
 <span style="color: #dbb40c" class="color">
gold.</span>  They were now both in a state of unprecedented physical fitness.

And such skirts as Ann Veronica had had when she entered the valley of

Saas were safely packed away in the hotel, and she wore a <span style="color: #ac7434" class="color"> leather </span> belt

and loose knickerbockers and puttees--a costume that suited the fine,

long lines of her limbs far better than any feminine walking-dress could

do. Her complexion had resisted the snow-glare wonderfully; her skin had

only deepened its natural warmth a little under the Alpine sun. She had

pushed aside her <span style="color: #069af3" class="color"> azure </span> veil, taken off her snow-glasses, and sat smiling

under her hand at the shining glories--the lit cornices, the <span style="color: #0343df" class="color"> blue
</span> 
shadows, the softly rounded, enormous snow masses, the deep places

full of quivering luminosity--of the Taschhorn and Dom. The <span style="color: #82cafc" class="color"> sky </span> was

cloudless, effulgent <span style="color: #0343df" class="color"> blue.</span> 



Capes sat watching and admiring her, and then he fell praising the day

and fortune and their love for each other.



“Here we are,” he said, “shining through each other like light through a

stained-glass window. With this air in our <span style="color: #770001" class="color"> blood,</span>  this sunlight soaking

us.... Life is so good. Can it ever be so good again?”



Ann Veronica put out a firm hand and squeezed his arm. “It’s very good,”

 she said. “It’s glorious good!”



“Suppose now--look at this long snow-slope and then that <span style="color: #0343df" class="color"> blue </span> deep

beyond--do you see that round pool of color in the <span style="color: #d6fffa" class="color"> ice-</span> -a thousand feet

or more below? Yes? Well, think--we’ve got to go but ten steps and lie

down and put our arms about each other. See? Down we should rush in a

foam--in a cloud of snow--to flight and a dream. All the rest of

our lives would be together then, Ann Veronica. Every moment. And no

ill-chances.”

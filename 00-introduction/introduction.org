#+TITLE: Introduction
#+AUTHOR: Jonathan Reeve

The early 20th century saw a dramatic change in the styles of British literature. The end of the Victorian era, with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, symbolized the beginning of a new era, and with it came a new aesthetics. This new aesthetics distinguishes itself from all those previous by means of its approach to visuality: not only did the writers of this generation /write/ differently, but they began to /see/ differently, as well. This dissertation investigates the changes in visuality that so strongly characterize this tumultuous time in literary history, and does so with qualitative and quantitive methods. Using techniques from computer science, statistics, and computational linguistics, I reveal the depth of the explosion of color and shape at the turn of the century, and present the reasons for this phenomenon.

Consider, as our starting point, this passage from Jane Austen's /Pride and Prejudice/, from 1813:

#+begin_quote
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.
#+end_quote

This passage contains concrete descriptors of people, places and things, and paints a clear and memorable tableau of the parsonage. Through the eyes of Austen's narrator, we see a house with a garden, a hedge, a gravel walk, and a small gate; an interior parlor, where drinks are being served, and where people are nodding and smiling. Yet this description is heavily subordinated to the interpersonal cordialities, relations, and emotions. We see indeed that the pales are "green," and the hedge made of laurel, but these things exist only to "declare they were arriving." In the foreground, we see a meeting between Elizabeth and Mr. and Mrs Collins, which is described in abstract emotional terms, emphasizing "the liveliest pleasure," in which Elizabeth is "more and more satisfied," and feels "affectionately received." We hear of rather vague "manners," "civility," and "enquiries after all her family," a certain "neatness" of the house, and the "ostentatious formality" of his welcome. While we should not dismiss these abstractions as /mere/ social drama---Austen's famously knowing style frequently contains subtexts of satire or social commentary---they nonetheless exemplify a style which is more concerned with social experience than vision. We will later find out that Austen is among the least visual writers of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Now, consider a passage from our destination, this passage from Virginia Woolf's /To the Lighthouse/, from over a hundred years later, in 1927:

#+begin_quote
The jacmanna was bright violet; the wall staring white. She would not have considered it honest to tamper with the bright violet and the staring white, since she saw them like that, fashionable though it was, since Mr. Paunceforte's visit, to see everything pale, elegant, semitransparent. Then beneath the colour there was the shape. She could see it all so clearly, so commandingly, when she looked: it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that moment's flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child. Such she often felt herself—struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage; to say: "But this is what I see; this is what I see," and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast, which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her.
#+end_quote

In contrast, Woolf's descriptive passage is thickly indulgent in its visuality. Lily Briscoe, painting a clematis, sees it through the eyes of a painter. There is a specificity of color which we rarely see in earlier literature: not just /violet/ or /white/, but /bright violet/ and /staring white/. Furthermore, the experience of this color has an impressionist quality: it is /pale, elegant, semitransparent./ In addition to the color, perceived by the eye's retinal cones, there is the shape, perceived by its rods. This passage is not only visual, but ocular: it deals with perception over, and before, its distillation into feeling. Although there are emotions present here, too, as in Austen, with "demons" bringing her "to the verge of tears," Lily's primary concern is her vision, as she repeats: "this is what I see; this is what I see."

So how do we get from point A to point B, from Austen to Woolf? This is a difficult question, since chronology alone cannot account for all these differences. For one, there is a huge generic difference: Austen writes within the genre of the social drama, romance, or social satire, depending on your point of view. Woolf's novel, however, is a /Künstlerroman/, and belongs to a high modernist genre of art-novel. There are also authorial styles and character voices to consider: the difference is not only between Austen and Woolf, but between Austen's narrator, aware of Elizabeth, and the free indirect discourse informed by Lily's thoughts. This is where computational analysis helps. By analyzing thousands of novels and poems, computationally---many more than a single human could hope to read---we can begin to isolate chronological signals, and adjust for the influence of genre, style, voice, and other factors.


Explain the "eye"
 - chapters are different parts of the retina

* Introduction
How were textual images conceived at the turn of the century? What properties did they possess, measurable or unmeasurable? In the famous preface to his 1897 novella /The Nigger of the Narcissus/, Joseph Conrad announces that his project is, "by the power of the written word," "to make you hear, to make you feel, ... before all, to make you /see/. That---and no more, and it is everything." I will argue that he means "seeing" literally: not merely in the metaphorical sense of seeing as understanding, but in the physiological sense, of seeing as a neuro-ocular process. Conrad explains that his task is to hold up, "before all eyes," a "passing phase of life ... to show its vibration, its colour, its form, and through its movement, its form, and its colour, reveal the substance of its truth" [cite:@conradPortableConrad2007 49]. This trinity---color, form, and vibration/movement---is so important to Conrad, or so conceptually slippery, that he allows it two iterations, even in an essay that stresses the importance of verbal economy. It is tempting to read these three words figuratively, to say that "colour," when describing "a passing phase of life" refers to an affective experience, rather than a hue, and that "form" refers to a conceptual structure, rather than the visual boundaries of physical objects. That would not be wrong. In fact, these, and more esoteric readings, are among the most typical.[fn:1]  But they overlook an equally valuable surface reading: that color and form are physiologically distinguishable ocular categories, corresponding to the rods and cones of retinal photoreceptors, and that they depend on light (vibrations in the visible electromagnetic spectrum) and a temporal dimension along which their movements may be perceived.

# "The main and perhaps most passionate tenet of impressionism was the suppression of the author from the pages of his book. He must not comment; he must not narrate; he must present his impressions of his imaginary affairs as if he had been present at them [...] the author is invisible and almost unnoticeable and [...] his attempt has been, above all, to make you see." [cite:@ford1939march 840].

The eye is more than just an adequate metaphor for the imagination of this period's writers. To understand modernism, one must first understand the image, along with its primary interface, and first image-processing neural apparatus, the eye. Images are most legible in the novels and poems of these writers, as I will show in the case-studies of chapters 4 and 5, but these creative works, like Conrad's /Narcissus/, are almost always accompanied with theoretical writings that frame, explicate, contextualize, and market them. In addition to introductions like the one above, this theory also appears alongside the literary works in their first contexts: "little magazines" that published mixtures poems, essays, criticism, chapters of novels, and reproductions of visual art.[fn:2] The critical accompaniments in these journals are not supplementary, in the Derridean sense of /external to/, the literary works they discuss, but are part of them [cite:@derridaGrammatology2016 145]. This is especially true of poems like /The Waste Land/, where after the first printing, the text has rarely been unadorned with Eliot's own footnotes, but is also true of a wide range of writing at this time.
# Matt: subject of above paragraph gets convoluted at the end

This period of literary history is so strongly autoexegetic that the theories of these writers deserves close examination, even when that theory is not consistently practiced. There are frequent and often-cited contradictions between the theories of these poet-critics and their practice, and yet these theories support a way of understanding and manipulating visual language, which not only reveals the centrality of vision and the image, but which shows definite and measurable properties of those images, leading ultimately to an ocular taxonomy. A study of literary images of the turn of the century, then, first requires a look at these immediate contexts: the secondary literature written by the authors of the primary.

The critical writings that appear in these journals: reviews, letters to the editor, essays, and more, provide the appearance of a complex network of discourse that surrounds the literature. Since that network is mostly comprised of a small coterie of recurring literary figures, some of them disguised with pseudonyms, and most of them friends, their publications in these public forums can at times feel staged. It has even been argued that the theoretical output of /imagisme/, the literary movement Ezra Pound furiously promoted in the early 1910s, was little more than a marketing tactic, or a constructed controversy. So it is with skepticism that we must proceed to study the many imagisms of this period: impressionism, symbolism, vorticism, and imagism itself, all of which, by nature of their visual preoccupations, I label as "imagisms." Instead of highlighting their differences, then, I would like to show their similarities: a common understanding of the image that transcends movements and manifestos.
# TODO: more on this

The most vivid theory of image in literature is found in I.A. Richards, a literary critic of this period who was influential to the school of "new critics." In his /Principles of Literary Criticism/ he diagrams the process of seeing, reading, and understanding a literary image, using a distinctly optical framework, as shown in [cite:@fig:richards] [cite:@richards2003principles 106].

#+CAPTION: Richards's Optical Process of Reading
#+LABEL: fig:richards
[[file:images/richards.png]]

Richards explains that the six distinct processes depicted vertically here correspond to events happening in succession, through which these lines cross, as "streams of impulses flowing through in the mind" (113):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
    I. The visual sensations of the printed words.
    II. Images very closely associated with these sensations.
    III. Images relatively free.
    IV. References to, or 'thinkings of', various things.
    V. Emotions.
    VI. Affective-volitional attitudes. (106-7)
  #+END_VERSE
#+END_QUOTE

Richards's schematic gives a sense of the complexity of the cognitive and emotional processes involved with reading words that bear visual significance. Not everyone produces mental images, as the psychological works covered in Chapter 1 attest, but images that readers produce are amalgamations of memories, emotions, attitudes, and sensations. Crucially, they are optic. Consider the resemblance of Richards's diagram to an illustration of retinal nerves, shown in Figure 2.

#+LABEL: fig:optic-nerve
[[file:images/optic-nerve.png]]

Richards, along with the modernists and imagists he studied, understood the reading process as a fundamentally visual one, shaped and even controlled by the mechanisms of the eye. I hope to show the ways in which ocular phenomena may be used to study the history of ideas in this period. This relies on a number of binaries, or distinctions these theorists make: the static and the dynamic, the fragment and the whole, the idea and its expression, the near and the distant, the specific and the general, the small and the cosmic, the hard and the soft, and the dry and the wet. These are not mutually exclusive categories, as I hope will be apparent, but are loci of ambiguities and complexities which attracted these writers to them in the first place, as they do us.

Contemporary criticism has often pointed out these pairs, but almost always uses them as a starting place for symptomatic readings: for instance, in Peter Nicholls on the implications of "hard" modernism; Rachel duPlessis on gendered aspects of the "dry" and "wet" in Pound; and Gibson on the "dry" and "hard" as neoclassicist [cite:@nichollsHardSoftModernism2013; @duplessisPropoundingModernistMaleness2002; @gibsonCONTRADICTORYIMAGESCONFLICTING2011a]. Jesse Schotter admirably problematizes the material membranes of the image and writing with his notion of "hieroglyphic" modernism, which synthesizes materialities of writing and image-making [cite:@schotter2018hieroglyphic]. His notion of the hieroglyphic is one that fuses writing and image-production, and is present in the many faux-Egyptologies of the early 20th century, as well as in Pound's /chinoiseries/. For Martin Jay, the modernist moment is a "crisis in ocularcentrism" which reflects "a deep-seated distrust of the privileging of sight" [cite:@jay88_rise 309]. Claudia Olk, as well, argues that a break with realism in early 20th century writing shifts conceptions of the visual from a representational and "natural" visual epistemology, to one a more "conceptual" and less "positivist" one:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"The category of vision is not only central to many modernist texts, but also plays a key role in the unfolding paradigm of modernism itself. The received sense of a modernist break with realism, its pervasive interest in the workings of the individual mind, and its generic reclassifications of the novel also intimately affected the role of vision, which gained a conceptual rather than natural status. Whereas realist texts adhere to a visual language of representation and become legible within a positivist epistemology, modernist texts clearly depart from this positivist faith." [cite:@olkVaguenessVisionVeil2007 153]
#+END_QUOTE

Epistemologies of visual perception, then, are a subset of a larger discussion surrounding subjectivity in fiction of this period, and in particular, literary-historical shifts in the treatment of subjectivities. In /The Pound Era/, Hugh Kenner notes that despite Pound's official stance on Imagism, the movement is nonetheless "named for a component of the poem, not a state of the poet, and that its three principles establish technical, not psychic, criteria" [cite:@kennerPoundEra1971 179]. Literary images are subjective, created in the mind of the reader, according to instructions from the poet, yet those instructions must pretend to be at least partially objective, or they will not be effectively communicated. I hope to unravel here some of these contradictions, problematize some of these dichotomies, and extend the readings of these critics to include concrete visual properties of the images created and manipulated by the writers of this period.

[fn:1] See, for example cite:@ennsVibrationSoundBirth2013 71. Ludwig Schnauder calls this sequence a blend of "the terms and concepts of Impressionism with a Victorian insistence on the truthfulness and moral sincerity of fiction" [cite:@schnauderFreeWillDeterminism2009, 98].

[fn:2] In Britain, these included /The Freewoman/ (1911--13) and /The New Freewoman/ (1913--14), /The Egoist/ (1914--19), and /The English Review/ (1908-1937). In the United States, influential journals included /The Little Review/ (1914--29), /The Dial/ (1880--29), and /Poetry/ (1912--).

* Method
The method I'm using in this study is one of computational literary analysis, a new discipline at the intersection of data science, computational linguistics, and the sub-discipline of computer science known as natural language processing. This is a practice of a discipline, or disciplines, variously termed digital literary studies, cultural analytics, or computational literary studies, which falls under a greater umbrella of digital humanities.[fn::For /digital literary studies/, see [cite/t:@siemens_companion_2013; and @hoover_digital_2014]. For /cultural analytics/, see [[https://culturalanalytics.org/][The Journal of Cultural Analytics]]. For /computational literary studies,/ see [[https://jcls.io/][The Journal of Computational Literary Studies]].]
I prefer /computational/ to /digital/, since it's more action-oriented: information will be computed, rather than simply digitized.

Franco Moretti famously calls his practice "distant reading" [cite:@moretti_distant_2013]; Ted Underwood also uses this term [cite:@underwood2019distant]; Matthew Jockers prefers "macroanalysis" [cite:@jockers_macroanalysis:_2013]; Andrew Piper, in /Enumerations/ studies quantitative aspects of literature through computational literary studies [cite:@piper2018enumerations].

* Corpus

I am limiting my analysis here to British literature of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Computationally, there are several advantages to these limits. First, using works published in Britain, and which use British English rather than American, we can collapse several spelling discrepancies which might account for mismatched

However, in practice, British literature is not so easy to define. The term as it is typically used includes the literatures of England, Wales, and Scotland, but often only those written in English, excluding Welsh, Scots, Scottish Gaelic, Cornish, and other languages of Great Britain.

This study thus considers works of British literature, written in English. More specifically, it's those works which the Library of Congress labels "PR," for British Literature, although I'll be using the term /British literature/ to describe it.

# Project Gutenberg
The natural choice for a text source was [[https://www.gutenberg.org/][Project Gutenberg]], a repository of over 60,000 electronic texts, in operation since 1971 [cite:@hart1992]. The texts in Project Gutenberg were originally hand-keyed, i.e., manually entered into a computer, and proofread by a team known as [[https://www.pgdp.net/c/][Distributed Proofreaders]]. This allows the texts, in comparison to those generated via optical character recognition, or OCR, to be of relatively high quality, without textual errors that could confound statistical results.

One drawback of Project Gutenberg, however, is that the metadata for its texts are not as complete as with other text repositories. Each text has metadata fields for title and author, a Project Gutenberg "bookshelf", a Library of Congress category, a Library of Congress subject heading, and the date of its publication on Project Gutenberg.
# TODO what metadata are here?
One missing field, which would be the most useful field for computational literary history, is the date of original publication. To find this, I had to devise a method for augmenting Project Gutenberg metadata with information from other public data repositories.

To accomplish that, I created [[http://corpus-db.org/][Corpus-DB]], a database and API for electronic texts from Project Gutenberg and other repositories. Using the title and author of the texts, I was able to write SPARQL queries to query the graph databases DBPedia and Wikidata. Both dictionary-based knowledge graphs, these databases maintain statements in the form of triples, e.g., ~<Ulysses> <first published> <1922>~. A SPARQL query could thus ask the database to fill in the question marks for a query such as:

#+begin_src sparql
select ?year where
<title> <written by> <author> .
<title> <first published> ?year
#+end_src
# TODO define SPARQL

I also gleaned some additional book data from APIs from Amazon, Goodreads, and Open Library.

From this I was able to find several thousand

Many of the major figures of the avant-garde lived and worked in London, but as expatriates from America. T. S. Eliot was born in Missouri, but moved to England at 25, where he lived for the rest of his life, eventually renouncing his American citizenship. Ezra Pound left America at 23, spending most of his life in England and on the contintent, and wouldn't return until facing trial for treason in the United States, and being committed to a mental institution.

I made the unconventional decision to produce this dissertation in HTML, rather than produce a Microsoft Word document or a PDF file. Since Word and PDF were created as proprietary formats, developed by Microsoft and Adobe, they were made to sell software, rather than contribute to the community. Furthermore, they are made to mimic the paper office, using a virtual 8.5 by 11 inch "page." Since this dissertation will not be printed, this constraint is unnecessary. HTML, on the other hand, is much more featureful markup language, allowing for interactive charts, hyperlinks, variable page width, and much, much more. Since it it always-already published on the Internet, it is much more easily archivable, readable with a wider variety of reading software (web browsers), and provides a more seamless experience for those using screen readers or other accessibility software.

One of the most important features of this HTML format is the capability to embed interactive charts. An interactive chart, like

</details><p>The central question of this dissertation is one of
literary history. It’s one of how we get from point A to point B.
Consider this passage from Jane Austen’s <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> to
be point A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,
every thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage;
his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were
in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
offers of refreshment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this passage from Virginia Woolf’s <em>To the Lighthouse</em> to
be point B:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jacmanna was bright violet; the wall staring white. She would not
have considered it honest to tamper with the bright violet and the
staring white, since she saw them like that, fashionable though it was,
since Mr. Paunceforte’s visit, to see everything pale, elegant,
semitransparent. Then beneath the colour there was the shape. She could
see it all so clearly, so commandingly, when she looked: it was when she
took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that
moment’s flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set
on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage
from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a
child. Such she often felt herself—struggling against terrific odds to
maintain her courage; to say: “But this is what I see; this is what I
see,” and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her
breast, which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Austen passage is one of her most descriptive: full of objects
and visualities, yet with images that are nonetheless subordinated to
the narrative.</p>
<p>In contrast, Woolf’s descriptive passage is thickly indulgent in its
visuality.</p>
<p>There is nothing quite as reductive as chronology, it must be
conceded.</p>
<p>By juxtaposing two paragraphs as historical artifacts, we are missing
that A belongs to a certain romance genre, while B belongs to an
artist-novel genre, in which aesthetic choices and visuality are
necessarily foregrounded.</p>
<section id="introduction-1" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>How were textual images conceived at the turn of the century? What
properties did they possess, measurable or unmeasurable? In the famous
preface to his 1897 novella <em>The Nigger of the Narcissus</em>, Joseph
Conrad announces that his project is, “by the power of the written
word,” “to make you hear, to make you feel, … before all, to make you
<em>see</em>. That—and no more, and it is everything.” I will argue that
he means “seeing” literally: not merely in the metaphorical sense of
seeing as understanding, but in the physiological sense, of seeing as a
neuro-ocular process. Conrad explains that his task is to hold up,
“before all eyes,” a “passing phase of life … to show its vibration, its
colour, its form, and through its movement, its form, and its colour,
reveal the substance of its truth” <span class="citation"
data-cites="conradPortableConrad2007">(Conrad 49)</span>. This
trinity—color, form, and vibration/movement—is so important to Conrad,
or so conceptually slippery, that he allows it two iterations, even in
an essay that stresses the importance of verbal economy. It is tempting
to read these three words figuratively, to say that “colour,” when
describing “a passing phase of life” refers to an affective experience,
rather than a hue, and that “form” refers to a conceptual structure,
rather than the visual boundaries of physical objects. That would not be
wrong. In fact, these, and more esoteric readings, are among the most
typical.<span><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">See, for example cite:@ennsVibrationSoundBirth2013 71.
Ludwig Schnauder calls this sequence a blend of “the terms and concepts
of Impressionism with a Victorian insistence on the truthfulness and
moral sincerity of fiction” <span class="citation"
data-cites="schnauderFreeWillDeterminism2009">(Schnauder
98)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> But they overlook an equally valuable surface reading:
that color and form are physiologically distinguishable ocular
categories, corresponding to the rods and cones of retinal
photoreceptors, and that they depend on light (vibrations in the visible
electromagnetic spectrum) and a temporal dimension along which their
movements may be perceived.</p>
<p>The eye is more than just an adequate metaphor for the imagination of
this period’s writers. To understand modernism, one must first
understand the image, along with its primary interface, and first
image-processing neural apparatus, the eye. Images are most legible in
the novels and poems of these writers, as I will show in the
case-studies of chapters 4 and 5, but these creative works, like
Conrad’s <em>Narcissus</em>, are almost always accompanied with
theoretical writings that frame, explicate, contextualize, and market
them. In addition to introductions like the one above, this theory also
appears alongside the literary works in their first contexts: “little
magazines” that published mixtures poems, essays, criticism, chapters of
novels, and reproductions of visual
art.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">In Britain, these included <em>The Freewoman</em>
(1911–13) and <em>The New Freewoman</em> (1913–14), <em>The Egoist</em>
(1914–19), and <em>The English Review</em> (1908-1937). In the United
States, influential journals included <em>The Little Review</em>
(1914–29), <em>The Dial</em> (1880–29), and <em>Poetry</em>
(1912–).<br />
<br />
</span></span> The critical accompaniments in these journals are not
supplementary, in the Derridean sense of <em>external to</em>, the
literary works they discuss, but are part of them <span class="citation"
data-cites="derridaGrammatology2016">(Derrida and Butler 145)</span>.
This is especially true of poems like <em>The Waste Land</em>, where
after the first printing, the text has rarely been unadorned with
Eliot’s own footnotes, but is also true of a wide range of writing at
this time.</p>
<p>This period of literary history is so strongly autoexegetic that the
theories of these writers deserves close examination, even when that
theory is not consistently practiced. There are frequent and often-cited
contradictions between the theories of these poet-critics and their
practice, and yet these theories support a way of understanding and
manipulating visual language, which not only reveals the centrality of
vision and the image, but which shows definite and measurable properties
of those images, leading ultimately to an ocular taxonomy. A study of
literary images of the turn of the century, then, first requires a look
at these immediate contexts: the secondary literature written by the
authors of the primary.</p>
<p>The critical writings that appear in these journals: reviews, letters
to the editor, essays, and more, provide the appearance of a complex
network of discourse that surrounds the literature. Since that network
is mostly comprised of a small coterie of recurring literary figures,
some of them disguised with pseudonyms, and most of them friends, their
publications in these public forums can at times feel staged. It has
even been argued that the theoretical output of <em>imagisme</em>, the
literary movement Ezra Pound furiously promoted in the early 1910s, was
little more than a marketing tactic, or a constructed controversy. So it
is with skepticism that we must proceed to study the many imagisms of
this period: impressionism, symbolism, vorticism, and imagism itself,
all of which, by nature of their visual preoccupations, I label as
“imagisms.” Instead of highlighting their differences, then, I would
like to show their similarities: a common understanding of the image
that transcends movements and manifestos.</p>
<p>The most vivid theory of image in literature is found in I.A.
Richards, a literary critic of this period who was influential to the
school of “new critics.” In his <em>Principles of Literary
Criticism</em> he diagrams the process of seeing, reading, and
understanding a literary image, using a distinctly optical framework, as
shown in fig. 1 <span class="citation"
data-cites="richards2003principles">(Richards 106)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/richards.png" id="fig:richards"
alt="Figure 1: Richards’s Optical Process of Reading" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 1: Richards’s Optical Process of
Reading</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Richards explains that the six distinct processes depicted vertically
here correspond to events happening in succession, through which these
lines cross, as “streams of impulses flowing through in the mind”
(113):</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">I. The visual sensations of the printed
words.<br />
II. Images very closely associated with these sensations.<br />
III. Images relatively free.<br />
IV. References to, or ‘thinkings of’, various things.<br />
V. Emotions.<br />
VI. Affective-volitional attitudes. (106-7)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Richards’s schematic gives a sense of the complexity of the cognitive
and emotional processes involved with reading words that bear visual
significance. Not everyone produces mental images, as the psychological
works covered in Chapter 1 attest, but images that readers produce are
amalgamations of memories, emotions, attitudes, and sensations.
Crucially, they are optic. Consider the resemblance of Richards’s
diagram to an illustration of retinal nerves, shown in Figure 2.</p>

</figure>
<p>Richards, along with the modernists and imagists he studied,
understood the reading process as a fundamentally visual one, shaped and
even controlled by the mechanisms of the eye. I hope to show the ways in
which ocular phenomena may be used to study the history of ideas in this
period. This relies on a number of binaries, or distinctions these
theorists make: the static and the dynamic, the fragment and the whole,
the idea and its expression, the near and the distant, the specific and
the general, the small and the cosmic, the hard and the soft, and the
dry and the wet. These are not mutually exclusive categories, as I hope
will be apparent, but are loci of ambiguities and complexities which
attracted these writers to them in the first place, as they do us.</p>
<p>Contemporary criticism has often pointed out these pairs, but almost
always uses them as a starting place for symptomatic readings: for
instance, in Peter Nicholls on the implications of “hard” modernism;
Rachel duPlessis on gendered aspects of the “dry” and “wet” in Pound;
and Gibson on the “dry” and “hard” as neoclassicist <span
class="citation"
data-cites="nichollsHardSoftModernism2013 duplessisPropoundingModernistMaleness2002 gibsonCONTRADICTORYIMAGESCONFLICTING2011a">(Nicholls;
DuPlessis; GIBSON)</span>. Jesse Schotter admirably problematizes the
material membranes of the image and writing with his notion of
“hieroglyphic” modernism, which synthesizes materialities of writing and
image-making <span class="citation"
data-cites="schotter2018hieroglyphic">(Schotter)</span>. His notion of
the hieroglyphic is one that fuses writing and image-production, and is
present in the many faux-Egyptologies of the early 20th century, as well
as in Pound’s <em>chinoiseries</em>. For Martin Jay, the modernist
moment is a “crisis in ocularcentrism” which reflects “a deep-seated
distrust of the privileging of sight” <span class="citation"
data-cites="jay88_rise">(Jay 309)</span>. Claudia Olk, as well, argues
that a break with realism in early 20th century writing shifts
conceptions of the visual from a representational and “natural” visual
epistemology, to one a more “conceptual” and less “positivist” one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The category of vision is not only central to many modernist texts,
but also plays a key role in the unfolding paradigm of modernism itself.
The received sense of a modernist break with realism, its pervasive
interest in the workings of the individual mind, and its generic
reclassifications of the novel also intimately affected the role of
vision, which gained a conceptual rather than natural status. Whereas
realist texts adhere to a visual language of representation and become
legible within a positivist epistemology, modernist texts clearly depart
from this positivist faith.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="olkVaguenessVisionVeil2007">(Olk 153)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Epistemologies of visual perception, then, are a subset of a larger
discussion surrounding subjectivity in fiction of this period, and in
particular, literary-historical shifts in the treatment of
subjectivities. In <em>The Pound Era</em>, Hugh Kenner notes that
despite Pound’s official stance on Imagism, the movement is nonetheless
“named for a component of the poem, not a state of the poet, and that
its three principles establish technical, not psychic, criteria” <span
class="citation" data-cites="kennerPoundEra1971">(Kenner 179)</span>.
Literary images are subjective, created in the mind of the reader,
according to instructions from the poet, yet those instructions must
pretend to be at least partially objective, or they will not be
effectively communicated. I hope to unravel here some of these
contradictions, problematize some of these dichotomies, and extend the
readings of these critics to include concrete visual properties of the
images created and manipulated by the writers of this period.</p>

<h2>The text itself</h2>
<p>I made the unconventional decision to produce this dissertation in
HTML, rather than produce a Microsoft Word document or a PDF file. Since
Word and PDF were created as proprietary formats, developed by Microsoft
and Adobe, they were made to sell software, rather than contribute to
the community. Furthermore, they are made to mimic the paper office,
using a virtual 8.5 by 11 inch “page.” Since this dissertation will not
be printed, this constraint is unnecessary. HTML, on the other hand, is
much more featureful markup language, allowing for interactive charts,
hyperlinks, variable page width, and much, much more. Since it it
always-already published on the Internet, it is much more easily
archivable, readable with a wider variety of reading software (web
browsers), and provides a more seamless experience for those using
screen readers or other accessibility software.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of this HTML format is the
capability to embed interactive charts. An interactive chart, like</p>

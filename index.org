This dissertation would not have been possible without the advice and support of a large network of scholars, at Columbia University and elsewhere. I'd like to thank my dissertation committee: Sarah Cole, Matthew Hart, and Dennis Tenen; the Literary Modeling and Visualization Lab, and the Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities at Columbia University; Explosion AI, who generously donated a research license to Prodigy, their proprietary human-in-the-loop AI model training software; and the members of the 20/21st Century Colloquium at Columbia University, who provided useful feedback on early drafts of the first chapter.
